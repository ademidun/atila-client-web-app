This happened to be the initial source of inspiration for creating the new graphic.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2D_2tcadYKkYtLL1Ut4RHSn0YlScUY3lQgqCkt9jafQRerl-tzSfhACBMUIyWsa2AX5QdHJq4-T5U9Iguss_zdmV6FiP30bFUPe0zTQITNOL_pJLI7j8epKMc9O2UhRibIVmTRqj\"></figure><p>If you look at the image in the bottom left corner, you can see one of the students wearing a <a href=\"https://www.aaihs.org/the-history-and-significance-of-kente-cloth-in-the-black-diaspora/\">Kente graduation cloth</a>. While each stole and its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft#:~:text=Warp%20and%20weft%20are%20the,%2Dand%2Dunder%20the%20warp.\">warp and weft motifs</a> represent something unique to the wearer, for Black students the tradition of wearing a Kente cloth at graduation signifies the successful completion of their degree while honouring their African heritage.</p><p>I knew that I had to include the Kente cloth in the design. I started with a base image from <a href=\"https://storyset.com/\">Storyset by Freepik</a>, and then edited away. I changed the colour scheme and orientation, altered the gown, and added the stole.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AcFOxus.jpg\"></figure><p>Once satisfied with the design, I had to make sure that the Kente cloth colours were correct. A quick online search of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=kente+graduation+cloth&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA903CA903&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01kmH2kwjl0x38G2Wlyjgx6JkQcBA:1624056885036&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwwuito6LxAhXM7Z4KHaGWA48Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=W6iG_MDYAiweoM\">Kente graduation cloth images</a> provided a great photo with clear, bold colours.&nbsp;</p><p>Using the “Inspect” tool, I was able to obtain the exact hex colour codes from the online image for each colour in the stole. Check out the GIF below to see how I inspected the colours on Google Chrome.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SzjERec.gif\"></figure><p>The hex color codes used in the design are #a91726 for red, #fbce3d for yellow, and #05a172 for green.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Xou5xJC.jpg\"></figure><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>A Cree Content Creator</h2><p>Once the design representing Black students was complete, it was time to create a design to represent Indigenous students. I’ll admit, inspiration didn’t immediately jump out at me.&nbsp;</p><p>What finally sparked an idea was actually some mindless scrolling on Instagram. I came across a post from a Cree content creator who I follow. Her name is Kendra Jessie and she is Sucker Creek First Nation from Alberta. You can find her on Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kendrajessie/\">kendrajessie</a>. Her photos in traditional clothing were the source of inspiration, but there was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CHZLGg4AXa4/\">one image in particular </a>that I chose to model the design after.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TcfOBoK.jpg\"></figure><p>Once again, I started with a base image from Storyset by Freepik. This time, the base image required significantly more alterations to create the final design. I changed the limb positions, created entirely new clothing pieces, and modified the colour scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>(Fun fact: The ribbons flowing from the cape are actually all the exact same shape. I just copied and pasted the shape many times over and changed the orientation, sizing, and colour of each iteration to create the effect.)</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GlyBAFs.jpg\"></figure><p>There was also a lot of fine detail work that went into this design. Just one of the detailed pieces created to include on the traditional dress required over 10 layers on Figma!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FIZsh6C.jpg\"></figure><p>Afterwards, “Inspect” was used again to get the hex codes from Kendra’s image and ensure that accurate colours were used in the design.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Voila! With a meaningful design for Black and Indigenous students each, the Atila Black and Indigenous Scholarship graphic was complete!</p><p>You can see the graphic for yourself <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQE7BaJM_f7/\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://atila.ca/scholarship/atila-black-and-indigenous-scholarship-oj0gx3at\">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.aaihs.org/the-history-and-significance-of-kente-cloth-in-the-black-diaspora/\">The History and Significance of Kente Cloth in the Black Diaspora</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sankofaedition.com/blogs/know-sankofa/what-is-a-kente-cloth-graduation#:~:text=While%20a%20typical%20graduate's%20stole,traditional%20West%20African%20Kente%20cloth.&amp;text=Kente%20was%20integrated%20by%20black,adopted%20into%20hip%20hop%20fashion\">What is a kente cloth graduation?</a></li></ul>",

Word counts are often arbitrary and can end up cutting people’s expression if they have more to say or force jargon if they have nothing more to say.</p><p>However, word counts are helpful because they help provide a useful benchmark of how much time and detail is expected in an application. Instead of enforcing word counts in scholarship applications, we’ve recently started sharing the table at the end of this page with students while they write their scholarship essays. This will help students make their own decisions about how much they want to write for a given application.</p><p>One of our <a href=\"https://atila.ca/values\">values</a> at Atila is to bet on people. We believe we should give students the freedom to make their applications as long or as short as they feel is right and that they will make the right choice if we provide the right guidance.</p><p>For example, at Atila we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomiwa1a/status/1418932327191830530\">suggest</a> that student applications should be at least 300 words to get a score of 8 but that the average scholarship winner has a word count of 500. The goal is to update this table periodically so that students have a better idea of how many words to write for a “good application”.</p><h3>Advice for Teachers and Students</h3><p>If you work in education and writing or grading essays is part of your work, try this method instead of enforcing word counts:</p><ol><li>Get the word counts of past essays you have graded<ol><li>There are many <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=free+word+counter\">free word count software</a> on the internet that makes your life easier</li><li>If you don’t have the ability or time to word count all your essays just pick the best applications<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Make a table to see the correlation between the length of the application (word count) and the quality (what grade it received), similar to the one we showed above. Here is a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIoYfPQAczrGUmkHVQWCXMk4sDCSnEf1NzhRjrZxato/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Sheet with some test data</a> which you can use.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li>Provide a “suggested” word count and provide a table showing the relationship between past essay scores and their word counts (or you can use ours!). Then let the students decide how many words they should write.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>If you’re a student, send your teacher this blog post and tell them to consider trying this method!</p><p>If there’s enough interest, we could write a python script that does this automatically for your essays. Tweet us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atilatech?lang=en\">@atilatech</a> and if enough people want it, we could build it.</p><h2>Detailed Analysis</h2><h3>Hypothesis</h3><p>From our team’s collective experience from reviewing applications, the apps that stand out are the ones that have ample points to support their argument. We look for points that provide justification and attention to detail for their research. A well-written application should also be in layman terms and have no distracting jargon. However, in order to explain ideas clearly, a high word count may be necessary. We acknowledge that it may be the case that high word count is not a function of application score, but rather the number of interesting points that the author writes. As average word count per long answer question increases, the application score should also increase.&nbsp;</p><p>Another interesting point to explore is whether maximum word count - when comparing different questions in a single application - has any correlation with score. Assuming there is some correlation between average word count and score, the presence of an outlier-type application response would theoretically boost an application’s status. In other words, having a standout application response next to several mediocre ones by a candidate should be enough to secure some percentage of score increase.&nbsp;</p><h3>Methodology</h3><p>There are 5 scholarships that are applicable for analysis in the Atila database. Every application from these five scholarships has a max_word_count, average_word_count, and average_user_score.&nbsp;</p><p>To determine the average/max word count for a certain bucket (Ex. Scholarship Winners), take the sum of all average/max word count and divide by the number of applications in the bucket. This method was used for all calculations on average values. The function STDEV was used for determining the standard deviation of each scholarship.</p><h3>Findings</h3><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Scholarship ID</td><td>Average Word Count</td><td>Standard deviation</td><td>Winner average_word_count</td><td>Winner_is_highest_word_count</td><td>Winner_avg_word_count_position</td></tr><tr><td>733</td><td>177</td><td>123</td><td>645</td><td>TRUE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>739</td><td>205</td><td>174</td><td>546</td><td>FALSE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>720</td><td>302</td><td>209</td><td>895</td><td>TRUE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>711</td><td>117</td><td>91</td><td>347</td><td>FALSE</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>719</td><td>208</td><td>118</td><td>437</td><td>TRUE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Results</td><td>202</td><td>162</td><td>574</td><td>60.00%</td><td>1.8</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><i>Analysis of 5 direct application scholarships on Atila’s website.&nbsp;</i></p><p>From the data above, no scholarship winner placed below fourth on word count, with an average of second place across all scholarships.</p><p>It’s important to note that all scholarship sample sizes are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central_limit_theorem.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,The%20central%20limit%20theorem%20(CLT)%20states%20that%20the%20distribution%20of,for%20the%20CLT%20to%20hold.\">at/above 30</a> (Central Limit Theory dictates that sample sizes &gt;= 30 are considered sufficient to calculate sample means). Thus, the impact from lack of available data - including variance at the extremes and presence of outliers - are not prevalent. Although 5 scholarships aren’t enough to declare a relationship, the overwhelming placements of high word count applications indicate a definitive relationship between word count and score. However, without analysis of key correlation measures such as the R-squared coefficient, an accurate conclusion cannot be drawn. The extent to which they are related will be explored further.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sagjGzzzEH-yq-mG6dbILnu5XkAEKje4Af6osLlYlkiPHBAAWZ5GPepPKqVmZ8wzOd9yvyv-9SETxWE8fi13XJEbJuWq_gqLCiVlk-S8SXKarZuE4N_iGydb0nKfML365G5ZK3we\"></figure><p><i>Relationship between average word count and score with logarithmic best fit curve&nbsp;</i></p><p>With the above set of data points, the relation between average user score and average word count can be best described as a logarithmic relation. The R-squared correlation from the above graph is 0.714. Seeing that R-squared measures the percentage of variance of a dependent variable that can be explained by the variance of an independent variable, there are several implications present.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, in statistics related to the social sciences, it’s notoriously hard to know the relationship between two variables, as there are always other factors in play that skew data. According to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/r-squared.asp\">Investopedia</a>, since predicting human behaviour is difficult, having an r-squared of over 0.5 is considered significant. With the r-squared figure at 0.714, we can say that change in average word count accounts for almost ¾ of the variance in user score. This revelation is significant because of the boundary-less properties of both its variables; both word count and score are implemented in school curriculums and college applications in addition to scholarships. Imagine a high school teacher telling students that how much a person writes accounts for almost 75% of their score increase. This finding can cause writers to rethink their core philosophies.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the high ratio of population standard deviation to population mean (162-202) is an indication of the presence of outliers stretching the data set in two directions. Usually, this is a cause for concern, as outliers are data aberrations that don’t accurately represent the line of best fit. However, in the business of scholarships applications (and any written answer, for that matter), selecting the best out of a population is precisely selecting the outliers. Applications are reviewed on the basis that they stand out from the crowd, exhibiting special qualities that few others possess. Thus, the presence of these outliers, coupled with a high R-squared coefficient, means that the applicants who write significantly more than their playing field tend to receive higher scores.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mX-P7GiJHJg1PHHDNVEbDV_w8Y6q7YixugN1ATFh3NwUaD2Xyg_SyrJGqhMlXb7L8tc1DqQzDZNjz0dJln6GueCba48v_gFQ5KVj5gWfdRtlE4razTTLNlbZRY6OMfkxRYxI5ZSH\"></figure><p><i>The relationship between maximum word count and score is slightly less correlated than average word count; this may be due to lack of completeness in an application&nbsp;</i></p><p>Similar to average word count, the R-squared correlation of the relationship between maximum word count and user score is 0.692. With virtually identical figures, it can be concluded that there is also a relationship there. The slight decrease in correlation can be explained by the criteria for scoring Atila applications, where completeness of application is assessed. Some applications may exhibit exemplary responses for one question, but lack depth for another, thereby lowering their score.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>From analyzing the data from Atila’s direct application scholarships, an application’s average word count has a strong correlation with how well it scores. This could be because of many factors related to reviewer psychology. One such study conducted by Andrew Tomkins, Min Zhang, and William D. Heavlin showed how “<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12708\">single-blind reviewing confers a significant advantage to papers with famous authors</a>”. Similar to this study, reviewers may be tempted to give higher scores to longer applications because it looks more legitimate.</p><p>Another explanation is one we explored earlier, which is that it is frequently impossible to express breadth of ideas in a concise manner.

Longer applications tend to score better\r\n- 70% of an application's score can be determined by its length\r\n- However, the relationship is logarithmic not linear (longer is not always better)",

Once the scholarship closed and the Skateboards for Hope team reviewed all of the amazing applications, they decided to include prizes for the second and third place winners as well! The second place winner received a Landyachtz Longboard and Skateboards for Hope merch, and the third place winner received a Nyjah Huston Skate Deck and S3 Wheels. To say the least, they were stoked!</p><p>To read more about the winners and finalists of the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship, check out our blog post <a href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/llmercer/meet-the-winner-and-finalists-of-the-skateboards-for-hope-scholarship/\">here</a>.</p><p>As each scholarship, sponsor, and target audience is unique, every scholarship requires a unique design and marketing strategy that is tailored for success.&nbsp;</p><p>See how we designed and promoted the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship and hear testimonials from the winner and finalists below!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Graphics</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Scholarship Promotion&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>The graphics used to promote the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship were designed by <a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/linda-zhang-21a2b9179\">Linda Zhang</a>, previously a marketing intern at Atila. She used a graphic design software called <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma </a>to create <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLKSucZsxcm/\">this Instagram carousel</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/29w-VAoVX_IJSv82ZgPgp2_TQJqqnaM_9q7CqObDg9369eLLJhxAZ7rnB5aBGvPWaZ9LNtLQxJibIMWq9iYvuCCc_T9cLbRAXII8iJ8F4qLEsQBbbFYk5qlURaIG80xyFimHgJMj\"></figure><p>We wanted to make it clear that the scholarship was open to students participating in not just skateboarding but any action sport; a skier and surfer were included in the second and third slide to reflect that. We also dedicated the third slide to inform users of <a href=\"https://skateboardsforhope.com/\">Skateboards for Hope</a> and emphasize their values of creating an all-inclusive skateboarding community.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x9smtzi.jpg\"></figure><p>Finally, we created <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLsfLHiMOhB/\">this French version</a> of the original design to post on our Instagram.

Using <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma</a> once again, current marketing intern <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-mercer-150a3a181/\">Lauren Mercer</a> designed the graphics to share the winner and finalists of the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship. That Instagram carousel can be found <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ6yZntMj2l/\">here</a>.</p><p>Each of the ten slides were created to showcase the winner, the finalists, and the stories behind their applications. The first two slides included photos and excerpts from each student, as well as specially designed figures to represent each of them.

Along with Skateboards for Hope, we decided that a video compilation of the winner and finalists performing their sports would be a great way to share the students' talents in a way that was unique to the first action sport scholarship in Canada!&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the video on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ9Ps0pAX_t/\">Instagram </a>and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BsgTiEwbKIc\">Youtube</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/BsgTiEwbKIc\"><div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsgTiEwbKIc\" style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How Did We Promote the Scholarship</h2><p>When it came time to promote the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship, we relied on many strategies to ensure we reached a wide audience of students all across Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Instagram</h3><p>Beginning many weeks before the scholarship deadline, each member of the team sent at least <strong>5-10 DM’s per week</strong> to action sport organizations in their assigned region requesting that they share the scholarship with their members.&nbsp;</p><p>Many organizations, and even some high schools, were more than willing to repost the scholarship on their story or feed</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rXjuawo.jpg\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2CtIqts.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Email&nbsp;</h3><p>At the same time that we began messaging organizations through Instagram, we also began promoting through email.

          "body":"<p>The nature of Atila’s platform means that we will eventually find ourselves in positions where we have to form opinionated stances on touchy subjects. We should start learning how to handle these situations now so we get better with time as we grow.</p><p>For example, I remember talking to a lawyer about the best way to incorporate Atila and she asked me, “What’s your policy if someone wants to create a scholarship for white supremacists?”</p><p>Me: “Obviously, white supremacists and all other hate groups are not allowed on our platform. But it’s more of a common sense/unwritten rule. I guess there’s no official written policy.”</p><p>The lawyer wasn’t exactly thrilled to hear that.</p><p>Right now we're small so we don’t really have to face these types of issues very often. And when we do, the stakes are pretty small. We have a couple thousand users and about 400 followers on Instagram. No one cares what we think. But as we grow, this will change.</p><p>Already we’ve had two minor incidents with<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ZK6Firb\"> someone who disagreed with the idea of the Justice for Indian Farmer’s Scholarship</a> and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ZK6Firb\">someone who said the naming of our BIPOC scholarship was discriminatory</a>.</p><p>These two incidents inspired me to reflect on something I’ve been thinking about for a while: How involved should we be on social or political issues?</p><p>There’s a wide spectrum of company involvement in social issues, ranging from abstaining as much as possible as<a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804\"> Brian Armstrong at Coinbase call their \"mission focused\" approach</a>, to a<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90626274/pour-one-out-for-the-tech-bro-uniform-patagonia-ditches-corporate-logos-on-its-vests\"> high social involvement approach by Yvon Chouinard at Patagonia</a> and many in-between, for example, the<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/shopify-ceo-sends-email-staff-saying-company-not-family-we-cannot-solve-every-societal-1592545\"> email Tobi Lutke sent to his team at Shopify</a>.</p><p>Atila is a for-profit company, so it’s important we stay focused on things that make us money. Especially because I believe that money is still the best tool for making any kind of social impact we want to have. But there’s more to life than making money (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</a> illustrates this point excellently). I’ve always seen Atila as a vehicle for transporting us to the type of society we want to have. This inevitably means getting involved in social or political issues when appropriate. So naturally, I think a balanced approach works best.</p><p>I’m still thinking through what that means in practice. Currently, it means being laser focused on getting as many scholarships and students on the platform as possible. If we choose to get involved in social or political issues we should focus on issues that relate to giving students financial and education freedom. We can always make exceptions. It’s not precisely a rule, but more of a rule of thumb.</p><p>Also, I think that while Atila is still small (and even as we grow!), we can afford to take more risks, experiment with different ways to handle these situations, share our thought process with our users and the public, then learn and iterate based on their feedback.</p><p><i>Read the</i><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ZK6Firb\"><i> screenshots of the internal conversation we had on Slack</i></a><i> to understand the context of what inspired me to write this (shared with my team member's permission).</i></p><p><i>If you have a question, comment or feedback, leave a comment on the</i><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/atila/comments/oh0h5e/how_atila_navigates_social_and_political_issues/\"><i> Reddit thread for this post</i></a> on<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/atila/\"> r/atila</a>.

Their mission is to shred the taboos that surround the skateboarding culture and the social stigma it carries.</p><p>Today, we’re excited to share with you the winner and finalists of the <a href=\"https://atila.ca/scholarship/skateboards-for-hope-scholarship-0eeakm66\">Skateboards for Hope Scholarship</a>. These are their stories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Applicant Stories</h2><p>The winner is Yumi Lee, a talented skateboarder in Toronto, Ontario who is also the co-founder and head instructor of <a href=\"https://www.yorkskateboarding.ca/home\">York Skateboarding Academy</a> where she teaches skateboarding to youth.</p><p>The finalists are Karolina Dobiszewska, Jamen Janzen, Faith Obadun, and Ashley Tajarrod. Read some snippets of their application below and click the links to see them in action.</p><p>We have <a href=\"https://atila.ca/scholarship\">more scholarships</a> available on the Atila platform. If you’re a student you can apply for any of our current scholarships now. If you’re interested in helping a student pay for their education you can <a href=\"https://atila.ca/start\">start or contribute</a> to a scholarship today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Yumi Lee - Winner</h3><p><strong>Tell us why extreme sports are important to you and how it has helped you in your life?</strong></p><p>Since the pandemic struck, my mental health has been pretty all over the place. I'm sure many people can relate. Dealing with the anxieties of not knowing what will happen in the world, not to mention graduating high school and applying to university, is a lot to handle. When I skateboard, somehow, all those worries magically disappear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell us about a time you overcame adversity and your goals for the future.</strong></p><p>When I first started playing baseball, I learned very quickly that it wouldn't be easy for me to prove myself.&nbsp;</p><p>My teammate and I would be benched in games significantly more often than our male counterparts, and we often wouldn't get feedback when we made mistakes. Since my coach didn't help me, I knew the only way I could prove myself would be to practice independently.</p><p>...the sport taught me so much about the world and how hard work and determination are some of my greatest strengths. I navigated a white, male-dominated space and proved everyone who ever doubted me wrong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here is a snippet of Yumi’s thank you letter:</strong></p><p>This scholarship is going to help me advance my education to become a teacher one day. I've always loved teaching and I've recently started my own skateboarding business where I will provide lessons to kids. I hope that soon, we will go non-profit, and we'll be able to host events for the community. One of my goals is to create safe spaces for minority populations to learn skateboarding.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>See Yumi skateboarding here:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i7gh7N0W_M\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i7gh7N0W_M</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Karolina Dobiszewska - Finalist</h3><p><strong>Tell us why extreme sports are important to you and how it has helped you in your life?</strong></p><p>Extreme sports are important to me because they help on my journey of living a fearless life. I try to live everyday by “Seek Discomfort” - I do things because they scare me. I want to stay daring, strong and not afraid of challenges, and my extreme sports, like snowboarding or surfing, greatly help me in that.</p><p><strong>Tell us about a time you overcame adversity and your goals for the future.</strong></p><p>After many hard years in Poland, I finally came to Canada in 2017.<i> </i>I started in gr.10 not knowing anyone, or anything about Canadian school system. I didn’t understand even much of what teachers were saying. It was also hard to connect with others, I felt like an outcast.</p><p>But I persevered, and decided I won’t let anyone else suffer the way I did. I became one of the Link Leaders. Since 2018, I’ve been welcoming newcomers to our school, giving tours, leading activities and helping them understand Canadian school. I wanted to be that friendly face, to make them feel they belong.</p><p>In the future, I want to be a respected director / DP - known for creativity, work ethics and integrity. I want to make films that’ll open eyes and spark meaningful conversations, about which people think months or years after.</p><p><strong>Here is a snippet of Karolina’s thank you letter:</strong></p><p>Receiving the board has brought me great joy because I’ve always wanted to get into this type of skateboarding...</p><p>I’m new here and this will surely be a great step to feel more a part of the Montreal Community.</p><p>I’m really thankful for the award and recognition!</p><p><strong>See Karolina snowboarding here:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/100008166091452/videos/pcb.2837256336556542/2837252456556930\">https://www.facebook.com/100008166091452/videos/pcb.2837256336556542/2837252456556930</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Jamen Janzen - Finalist</h3><p><strong>Tell us why extreme sports are important to you and how it has helped you in your life?</strong></p><p>I love how the skateboarding community brings all kinds of people together. Its such a great feeling to pull up to any local skatepark and be greeted with heartfelt fistbump and a “what's up man?' from a local homie. Skateboarding breaks down barriers of age and socioeconomic status. It doesn't matter how old or young you are, what your background is or how much money you have, all you need is a board and a passion for skating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell us about a time you overcame adversity and your goals for the future.</strong></p><p>Any time I would get stressed out or a wave of angry energy would take control I'd grab my board and skate the mini ramp. Even just pumping around would help me calm down. My family had never been more thankful for the ramp then during these testing times!</p><p>As I get older I am becoming more self aware and intentionally working on being the best version of myself daily. I know that extreme sports will always be part of who I am and how I want to do life. I am skating my hardest with a goal of one day being sponsored from a local shop/ company in my city.</p><p><strong>Here is a snippet of Jamen’s thank you letter:</strong></p><p>I am very appreciative and stoked on the board!</p><p>...[Skateboarding is] a very big passion of mine and I thought, if there’s a way I can win something for talking about my skating, why wouldn’t I not try. It was a fun opportunity.</p><p>Thank you again Skateboards for Hope!</p><p><strong>See Jamen skateboarding here:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bX5dzwhEkE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bX5dzwhEkE</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Faith Obadun - Finalist</h3><p><strong>Tell us why extreme sports are important to you and how it has helped you in your life?</strong></p><p>Skateboarding has grown to be so important to me in ways I never imagined. It has been a great means for me to get away from reality for a while and just be in tune with nature and life as a whole.</p><p>During times when life feels overwhelming and I go skateboarding, I come back home feeling less heavy and a little happier than how I was.</p><p><strong>Tell us about a time you overcame adversity and your goals for the future.</strong></p><p>Having lived in Nigeria all my life up until I was 13, moving 10,000km from the only home I knew had a huge effect on what I knew my life to be.</p><p>I spent time learning about myself, things I love, what makes me smile, my goals and ambitions, more generally, what makes me ‘Faith’. Now, this move set the stage for not only changes but also a heart of gratitude. It showed me how to appreciate my cultural background, morals, childhood memories and most importantly the sacrifices my parents continue to make to provide me with a better life than they ever dreamed to have.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>See Faith skateboarding here:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/503coCiizHM\">https://youtu.be/503coCiizHM</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Ashley Tajarrod - Finalist</h3><p><strong>Tell us why extreme sports are important to you and how it has helped you in your life?</strong></p><p>Extreme sports are also individual sports that allows one to pursue obstacles that is only depended on the person. This makes an extreme athlete, such as myself independent, driven, and accountable for all my actions. Whenever I want to tackle anything in my life, such as school, work, relationships, etc, I know that I can achieve anything through positivity, practice, and patience.</p><p><strong>Tell us about a time you overcame adversity and your goals for the future.</strong></p><p>On March 06 2020, I was prepared to compete in Canada’s Olympic Open Qualifiers. Although I was trying to control my composure, I ended up re-injuring my right foot only five minutes before the competition. I was absolutely stunned, frustrated, and angry, I felt defeated just by doing what I love.&nbsp;</p><p>After five months of physical rehab, I ended up moving out of my family's house and to a place that is closer to Toronto's best skatepark...</p><p>I still skate to this day and will continue to progress regardless of given situations. I want to skate for as long as possible. To travel, compete, film, in regards to skating is all I live for.</p><p><strong>See Ashley skateboarding here:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ashleeelettuse/\">https://www.instagram.com/ashleeelettuse/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See more on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ6yZntMj2l/\">Instagram</a>!</p>",

What did you learn and how have you grown from that experience?:</p><p><i>March 12, 2020, 9:49 AM: </i>I thought it would be another typical university morning. There I was, sitting at my desk studying for back to back midterms that weekend. Little did I know that midterms would be the last thing on my mind when I went to sleep that night…</p><p>That afternoon felt like days, months, even years. As we gathered around the hospital room, patiently waiting for some (<i>hopefully</i>) good news, many of us were silent. You could sense the tension in the room and more than likely hear the drop of even a feather.</p><p>At about 2:00 PM, we were informed by one of the nurses that my mother would be transferred to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) upstairs…</p><p>When you're hit with such a shocking tragedy, it often makes you feel emotionless. This emptiness that runs throughout your body is dangerous. Not because you feel nothing, but because eventually, you feel everything. The worst part, you never know when this sudden rush of grief will strike. In my case, it happens when I eat, when I go to certain stores, and when I am lying in bed each night. Even if I try to fight it, there is no hope, you have to let it run its course...</p><p>Overcoming obstacles in life is not easy. Whether you are suffering from a physical disability, a mental health issue, or an internal struggle at home, the most important point to remember is that it does get better. There will be many days when it seems like giving up is easier, when it seems that nothing is going your way, or when it seems like the world is against you.&nbsp;</p><p>This obstacle in my life has taught me how to cope with my emotions, how to sympathize with others, and how to remove negative distractions around me. There are some things you will never have control over, but you do have control over how you choose to move forward. I pledge to move forward by living life through the meaning of a simple word, “believe.”</p><p>What are your goals and plans for the future?:</p><p>While I may be just a third-year student, my passion and drive to succeed is limitless. I’m currently studying Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University, with a minor in Economics and UX Design.</p><p>I also started a podcast, <a href=\"https://sportsbizwithrashaad.com/\">SportsBiz with Rashaad</a>. This platform also allows me to conduct interviews with professionals in the sports industry and learn everything I need to make my dreams a reality.</p><p>Here is a snippet of Rashaad’s thank you letter:</p><p>Honestly, it would have been so easy for me to give up along the way and feel like the world was against me. Yet, I continued to persevere and be resilient because I believe in a better future through hard work and determination...</p><p>...This scholarship has proven to me that my belief in myself can be recognized by others and can hopefully inspire people to overcome the challenges that they may face themselves. Being the recipient of this scholarship would have also made my mom proud and I’m so happy with that. This scholarship truly is more than just money to me.</p><h3>Avinandita Das - Mojisola Rufai and Victoria Ademidun Scholarship</h3><p>How has growing up in a low-income family impacted you? How do you plan on improving the situation for your family and other families like yours?:</p><p>Growing up in a low-income household with social stigmas all around us hasn’t always been a smooth journey for a first-generation immigrant such as myself…</p><p>...Everything has its pros and cons just like being in a financially unstable family. I started appreciating the small things that life had to offer and was extremely grateful to have food and shelter over my head...</p><p>...In order to fix this problem, these communities need more community centres with employment opportunities and work-fairs. Programs that can help them gain different skills that are needed for various jobs. In the future I plan to work alongside community centres in low-income communities and dedicate my time to help provide them resources and job opportunities.</p><p>What are your plans and goals for the future?:</p><p>In the near future, I would like to work alongside the education board regarding mental health support systems in schools, and help provide students in low income neighbourhoods with more mental health support.</p><p>I hope to dismantle the cultural stigma surrounding mental health in racialized low-income communities and work towards having high quality mental health care in the schools located in these neighbourhoods.</p><p>Here is a snippet of Avinandita’s thank you letter:</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your generosity in funding the&nbsp; Mojisola Rufai and Victoria Ademidun Scholarship. I am very honoured to be the recipient of this award…</p><p>...My family and I immigrated to Canada in the year of 2013. Though it was difficult to adjust to the lifestyle here as well as help my parents, it never stopped me from trying harder instead acted as a motivator factor for me...</p><p>...I would personally like to say thank you once again for this award and your generosity, both my family and I feel very blessed for receiving this opportunity.</p><h3>Kartik Dalal - Olumide and Aramide Ademidun Scholarship</h3><p>What are your goals and plans for the future?:</p><p>My career goal after graduating is to work in digital marketing and strategy for a Fortune 500 company. As COVID-19 has accelerated the world towards a digital-first environment, I believe these skills will be increasingly valuable as companies have to compete in a crowded digital world.</p><p>I also hope to work in a foreign country for a few years to meet new groups of people with different backgrounds and hopefully learn a new language and skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a snippet of Kartik’s thank you letter:</p><p>Thank you so much for creating this scholarship and the Atila program that helps make education more accessible for students across Canada...</p><p>...As the child of immigrants, the value and importance of education has been instilled in me since I was a kid and I aim to repay this generosity by eventually creating a scholarship for low-income students that have lost a parent which brings mental challenges of grief but also immense financial challenges.&nbsp;</p><h3>Geoffrey Fang - Olumide and Aramide Ademidun Scholarship</h3><p>How have you overcome adversity? What did you learn and how have you grown from that experience?:</p><p>Life can change in an instant. I learned that the hard way in August of 2015, when I picked up the phone from my doctor. I had cancer…</p><p>...I have grown tremendously in character, in skill and in wisdom from both my battle with cancer and the opportunities that I seized along the way...</p><p>...Overcoming adversity isn’t just about surviving a predicament; it's about turning that predicament into an opportunity. An opportunity to learn and to grow. An opportunity to create change.</p><p>What are your goals and plans for the future?:</p><p>My current plan for the future is to pursue an engineering degree, and reach my goal of improving the health of others around the world with smart technology, like smart watches, through engineering.</p><p>I see tremendous social and economic value in investing in health products and I hope one day, I can engineer the next medical device that saves lives just as the medical technology today saved mine.</p><p>Here is a snippet of Geoffrey’s thank you letter:</p><p>The community has supported me through my tumultuous times, given me opportunities to reach ahead, and given me the lessons to continuously improve myself...</p><p>...Thank you for giving students like me the encouragement to continue to pursue our dreams. Thank you for easing the financial burdens of a university degree for myself and my family. Thank you for being selfless in the face of your own needs. And most of all, thank you for believing in me…</p><p>...Once again, thank you for granting me the Olumide and Aramide Ademidun scholarship and believing in me and my future.</p><h3>Darasimi Jakande - Olumide and Aramide Ademidun Scholarship</h3><p>How have you overcome adversity? What did you learn and how have you grown from that experience?:</p><p>What is life without adversities? What is life without Trials? I will forever be grateful for the challenges I have faced because they are what made me who I am today…</p><p>...Nevertheless, I am thankful for boarding school, I am thankful for my experience at high-school, I am thankful for a job, I am thankful for every family that has helped me, I am thankful for my family, and most especially, I am thankful to God for keeping me through it all.&nbsp;</p><p>What are your goals and plans for the future?:</p><p>Over the years, I have realized that doing well in my academics is great, but it is not all that matters in life.</p><p>And with the program I am in right now, I am learning how to identify and address issues related to water. I believe this knowledge will help me achieve my goal.&nbsp;</p><p>If all else fails, this is one goal I would strive to achieve because I find joy from seeing other people happy.</p><p>Here is a snippet of Darasimi’s thank you letter:</p><p>I cannot explain how excited and honored I am to be a recipient of the \"Olumide and Aramide Ademidun\" scholarship award...</p><p>...My end goal is to own a charitable organization in which I would use my skills and previous knowledge to provide clean and safe water to families in Africa…</p><p>...I hope that one day I would also be able to give back and help students who have overcome adversity to reach and achieve their educational goals just as you have helped me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See More on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CP3RFEesrX-/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6808049782238576640/\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atilatech/status/1402287704876982283\">Twitter</a></p>",

          "body":"<p><strong>Nuclear Energy: A Powerful Source with Significant Risks</strong></p><p><strong>By: Austin, Malana, Prottoy, Ryan, and Shania</strong></p><p><strong>WHAT IS NUCLEAR ENERGY?</strong></p><p>Nuclear energy is the energy in the nucleus, or core, of an atom. Nuclear energy comes from splitting atoms (nuclear fission) in a reactor to heat water into steam, turn a turbine, and generate electricity. A nuclear reactor, or power plant, is a series of machines that can control nuclear fission to produce electricity.</p><p><strong>HOW IS NUCLEAR ENERGY CREATED?</strong></p><p>1. Nuclear reactors use pellets of the element uranium</p><p>2. Atoms of uranium are forced to break apart</p><p>3. Atoms release tiny particles</p><p>4. Fission products cause a chain reaction</p><p>5. Energy released creates heat</p><p>6. Heat created by nuclear fission warms water</p><p>7. The heated water produces steam</p><p>8. The steam turns the turbines or wheels&nbsp;</p><p>9. The turbines drive generators or engines</p><p>10. Electricity is created!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ADVANTAGES:</strong></p><p>There are a number of huge advantages to nuclear energy, though these are often overshadowed by the negative perceptions in the public mind. Nuclear energy creates many high-paid jobs; in the United States alone, 100,000 people are currently employed in well-paid long-term nuclear energy careers. Even more importantly, nuclear energy helps tackle climate change with carbon-free electricity and does not emit any air pollutants during the energy generation process. Another significant positive is its potential to power developing countries in particular, because of the low operation cost and high energy density. As well, there is highly sufficient fuel availability while we search for even greener energy technology, an estimated 200 years of uranium supply. Last, but certainly not least, it is a reliable source of energy that does not depend on weather conditions, unlike wind and solar power. Moreover, nuclear energy can be used in conjunction with other forms of renewable energy; nuclear energy output can be increased or decreased depending on how sources like wind and solar are performing and how the weather conditions are at that time.</p><p><strong>ECONOMICS</strong></p><p>The economic revenue for 104 nuclear units in electricity sales, are around $40-$50 billion dollars each year, with well over 100,000 workers contributing to the production of the nuclear units.&nbsp; Currently there are around 440 nuclear power plants around the world.&nbsp; In 2019 these plants provided over 10% of the world’s electricity.&nbsp; The global market for nuclear products, services, and fuel was around $500-$740 billion dollars in the past 10 or so years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DISADVANTAGES:</strong></p><p>As no system can be perfect, nuclear energy comes with a few disadvantages. The first one is that it is expensive. It costs over 9 billion American dollars to build one plant. Another disadvantage to nuclear energy is that it is often not given a chance to be used due to negative public perceptions. Much of the general public sees nuclear energy as dangerous and unstable. This is due to the incorrect direct association with nuclear weapons and nuclear energy portrayal in media and television. Nuclear energy also poses the opportunity for a negative environmental impact. As previously mentioned, nuclear energy plants use uranium. The uranium has to be mined, which can affect the environment through the release of uranium mine gases such as radon and arsenic. Thermal pollution can occur when bodies of water are used to cool down plants. Once the water cools down the plant, it is released back into the original body thus increasing the temperature. Additionally, radioactive waste is produced. This stays contaminated for thousands of years after it is created and there is currently no way to neutralize it; instead it is stored in facilities. It is also a non-renewable source of energy since Nuclear energy relies on finite resources such as uranium. It is estimated that uranium will be depleted from the earth within the next 200 years but this is being expedited as nuclear energy progresses. Lastly, there is a risk for nuclear accidents. Nuclear meltdowns such as Chernobyl can cause death and long and short term health problems, especially thyroid cancer. Nuclear energy has several disadvantages but is still a viable and mostly safe method to produce energy.</p><p><strong>NUCLEAR SAFETY AND PAST INCIDENTS:</strong></p><p>The public is often very wary of nuclear energy programs, and for good reasons, as one might argue. From Chernobyl to Three Mile Island, the world is no stranger to nuclear disasters of catastrophic scale. Ever since the conception of the first nuclear reactor in 1951, we have braced a grand total of 30 nuclear accidents to date, with the very first taking place barely a year after 1951 right in our homeland of Canada. Needless to say, any ambitious environmentalist looking to establish even a temporary nuclear program has to fight an uphill battle against a skeptic society.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the story changes completely once we take public perception out of the picture. Despite what the people have been led to believe, nuclear energy is an extremely safe, if not sustainable, source of energy that can be the key to transitioning out of a fossil fuel based economy into one reliant on renewable resources. Even if nuclear energy does not provide us with the solution to the centuries-old problem of energy, it is still bound to buy us valuable time required to conduct the research necessary to ensure a smooth transition. This is knowledge that we desperately need but potentially do not have the time for, due to the dire nature of the climate crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>But setting aside the endless potential of a nuclear world, we must first tackle the question of safety. Surprisingly, most experts agree that a country reliant on nuclear energy is not necessarily an unsafe one, given that the respective administrative bodies, like the local government, invests in up-to-date technology and allows for civilian oversight. To understand this sentiment, we must first understand the three worst nuclear disasters in human history: Chernobyl, Fukushima Daiichi, and Three Mile Island.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chernobyl nuclear disaster was arguably the worst nuclear accident of the 30 in the list. The blast alone claimed the lives of 31 individuals and its effects on the surrounding environment is still visible to the naked eye. But before we delve any further into this issue, we must first acknowledge that due to the authoritarian nature of the government that oversaw Chernobyl, a lot of information available on the disaster is often very speculative and therefore is subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, this report will do its best to do justice to each point and nuance that has been made available. That said, the exact death toll of the disaster is still being heavily debated among experts. According to the TORCH-Report as commissioned by the European Green Party and published in 2006, the disaster will be responsible for the deaths of anywhere between 30,000 to 60,000 individuals by 2065. However, the World Health Organization, in a joint investigation with the UNDP, the World Bank, the IAEA, and several East European governments, concluded that the disaster will not claim any more than 4000 lives in a similar time period. Most estimates fall in the middle of these two numbers, with most agreeing that the death toll should approach 12,000 by 2065. However, it must be noted that deaths may have been easily avoided had the accident occurred under the governance of a democratic society. This is a point that can be illustrated through the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.&nbsp;</p><p>Many consider Fukushima to be a fierce contender to Chernobyl for the worst nuclear disaster in human history. But that is a terrible comparison. They are not alike in any way, shape, or form whatsoever. For starters, unlike the Chernobyl disaster, the direct blast did not result in any verifiable deaths. Researchers have pegged the combined death toll of the incident to anywhere between 0 to 573 deaths. However, as many will point out, these 573 deaths were the result of the stress caused by the evacuation in the elderly population, rather than a direct result of the accident. Moreover, most experts believe that the incident will result in anywhere between 0 to 1000 fatalities over the next couple of decades.&nbsp;</p><p>As one might rightfully point out, that is a death toll that does not come even close to the disaster that was Chernobyl. This, as mentioned earlier, is a direct result of the governing bodies of these respective regions. Where Chernobyl was ruled by the Soviets, Fukushima was overseen by the democratically elected Japanese government. Due to the autorotative nature of the USSR, the government’s immediate course of action was to maintain a steady image rather than investing in damage control in the region. In contrast, the Japanese government immediately deployed extensive measures to assist Fukushima without merely attempting to hide the damage. Moreover, Chernobyl was being operated with outdated and poorly maintained technology by poorly trained personnel. Japan, on the other hand, was operating with state-of-the-art nuclear technology and with experienced engineers that were able to bring the situation under control. Similarly, the Three Mile Island incident saw 0 casualties, due to the swift actions by the United States government.&nbsp;</p><p>Though almost no nuclear disasters have been as disastrous as Fukushima or Chernobyl (other than Kyshtym, which also occurred inside USSR territory), one might still be reasonably wary of nuclear energy. After all, even 1000 deaths is not an unignorable amount. However, to understand this metric, we must first understand the casualties caused by our current systems of energy production. According to estimates from the WHO, an approximate 4.2 million people around the world die prematurely due to air pollution. The number of people losing their lives to pollution becomes a lot higher when we account for the numerous oil spills and oil rig explosions. Compared to that, a one-in-a-million chance that a region might see slight casualties is a risk that we believe is worth considering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CLOSING REMARKS ON&nbsp; SUSTAINABILITY: IS NUCLEAR A GOOD SOURCE OF ENERGY?</strong></p><p>Sustainability involves responsible interactions with the environment to avoid depletion or degradation of natural resources while allowing for long-term environmental quality. Therefore, we agree that, although nuclear energy might present itself as a “good” source of energy, it is not the best option for the future as there are more sustainable options available for energy production.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p><p>Duke Energy.
