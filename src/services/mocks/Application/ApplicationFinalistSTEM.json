            "response": "\n<blockquote>\n<h2><em>&ldquo;The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></h2>\n<p>- Kurt Vonnegut</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>I love Kurt Vonnegut&rsquo;s quote but the part about not being able to make a living in the arts scares me? Is that really true?</h2>\n<p>While this Vonnegut quote is an absolutely amazing summation of why you should do anything artistic, we would have to disagree with the part about not being able to make a living. There will always be a place for art and artists in the world. The numbers also don&rsquo;t lie. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hour wage for artists in 2010 was $28 and hour, $21.50 for sculptors, and $21 for craft and fine artists. The numbers may not be particularly impressive, but consider that the total median wage for all occupations in the same year was $16.27, and the artist-related wages start to sound much better.</p>\n<h2>OK, that makes me feel much better but what are some potential rewards outside of financial gain?</h2>\n<p>For starters, we would say everything. If art is truly your passion, then the number one benefit of being an artist is being able to live up to your highest calling. The greatest artists and athletes in every field (comedy writer Adam McKay, Bruce Springsteen, and surfer Kelly Slater to name a few) have all said that they would still be doing their craft even if they weren&rsquo;t superstars, because they love it so much.</p>\n<h2>Let&rsquo;s say that your career in the world of art does not work out then what do you have to show for it?</h2>\n<p>First of all, we want to say most importantly, it will work out. Even if you never become a household name, it's perfectly possible to spend your life as a working and not-too-struggling artist. With the right amount of determination, focus and belief, you can absolutely make a career in the arts work. Now, the skills you develop in honing an artistic craft are irreplaceable especially in a fluid economy built on rewarding innovative ideas. If you&rsquo;re an artist you can use those skills in marketing, graphic design and fashion. Creative and straight-to-the point writers are needed in every field, and sculptures can have a tremendous influence on the field of architecture.</p>\nsource: https://www.gonavis.com/blog/little-known-benefits-being-artist\n"
