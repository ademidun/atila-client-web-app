            "description":"The Bill 7 Award is a scholarship for individuals with demonstrated financial need after accessing available public financial supports, who are pursuing their first post-secondary program of study. The Bill 7 Award Trust was established in 1987 to provide post-secondary education scholarships to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, two-spirited or queer (LGBTQ) students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing a first degree, diploma or certification in any Ontario post-secondary institution. The Bill 7 Award is named after the 1986 Ontario legislation that extended the protection of the Human Rights Code to lesbians and gays. The Trust was founded by six community groups, predominantly led by women: the UofT Women’s Centre, the Lesbian and Gay Community Appeal (now the CommunityONE Foundation), Lesbians of Colour, The Black Women’s Collective, Zami, and the Toronto Counselling Centre for Lesbians and Gays.\nToday, Bill 7 Award trustees are appointed by our two current partner organizations, Supporting Our Youth (SOY) of the Sherbourne Health Centre, and the Community One Foundation, successors to the original founding groups. Since 1987, the Bill 7 Award Trust has granted over $200,000 in scholarships to students in the queer community to help them with the cost of post-secondary education. All scholarship funds are raised through donations. We have been working hard to increase both the number and size of the available scholarships. In 2020, we were able to award 17 scholarships of $3500 each.",
