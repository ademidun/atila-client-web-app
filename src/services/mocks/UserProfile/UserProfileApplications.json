I</p><p>want to leave with a degree that I hope will give me a competitive advantage in the global job</p><p>market and access to an alumni network that will benefit me in my professional endeavors. I</p><p>want to leave Queen’s with an awareness of all the possibilities for success that exist in our</p><p>global village.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My long term vision beyond my time at Queen’s University involves seeking lucrative opportunities in emerging markets like China, Dubai, and Nigeria. My main interests</p><p>include property development and alternative energy sources, industries which I hope to become</p><p>more exposed to during my time here at Queen’s. Initially, I would love to work with a property</p><p>development firm or a renewable energy company in one of these countries, become acquainted</p><p>with the business culture and eventually start my own business that will target the growing</p><p>“noveau riche” demographic in these countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is quite evident how a degree in business or</p><p>engineering would benefit me if I decided to go this route; but I also believe that a Queen’s</p><p>degree will be even more beneficial due to its recognition around the world and the popular</p><p>exchange program in its third year commerce program which would help me develop contacts</p><p>around the world.
