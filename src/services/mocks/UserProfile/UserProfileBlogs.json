            "body": "<p><a href=\"https://skateboardsforhope.com/\">Skateboards for Hope</a> was Atila’s very first external sponsor, and Canada’s first ever action sport scholarship that we created together was a huge success!&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://atila.ca/scholarship/skateboards-for-hope-scholarship-0eeakm66\">Skateboards for Hope Scholarship</a> was a $500 scholarship eligible to any Canadian student who performs an extreme sport. Once the scholarship closed and the Skateboards for Hope team reviewed all of the amazing applications, they decided to include prizes for the second and third place winners as well! The second place winner received a Landyachtz Longboard and Skateboards for Hope merch, and the third place winner received a Nyjah Huston Skate Deck and S3 Wheels. To say the least, they were stoked!</p><p>To read more about the winners and finalists of the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship, check out our blog post <a href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/llmercer/meet-the-winner-and-finalists-of-the-skateboards-for-hope-scholarship/\">here</a>.</p><p>As each scholarship, sponsor, and target audience is unique, every scholarship requires a unique design and marketing strategy that is tailored for success.&nbsp;</p><p>See how we designed and promoted the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship and hear testimonials from the winner and finalists below!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Graphics</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Scholarship Promotion&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>The graphics used to promote the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship were designed by <a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/linda-zhang-21a2b9179\">Linda Zhang</a>, previously a marketing intern at Atila. She used a graphic design software called <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma </a>to create <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLKSucZsxcm/\">this Instagram carousel</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/29w-VAoVX_IJSv82ZgPgp2_TQJqqnaM_9q7CqObDg9369eLLJhxAZ7rnB5aBGvPWaZ9LNtLQxJibIMWq9iYvuCCc_T9cLbRAXII8iJ8F4qLEsQBbbFYk5qlURaIG80xyFimHgJMj\"></figure><p>We wanted to make it clear that the scholarship was open to students participating in not just skateboarding but any action sport; a skier and surfer were included in the second and third slide to reflect that. We also dedicated the third slide to inform users of <a href=\"https://skateboardsforhope.com/\">Skateboards for Hope</a> and emphasize their values of creating an all-inclusive skateboarding community.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x9smtzi.jpg\"></figure><p>Finally, we created <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLsfLHiMOhB/\">this French version</a> of the original design to post on our Instagram. This was to reach out to students in francophone communities and encourage them to also apply!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_4DPdkO6LsTjkaeNwSIBdDkigplRWTKdFxHgqg14pBt-FSHmqSZ-urZTTG68O8XNXc69u0Z3M8PTUo50asuqdFiJHT-G9hTDfik2OCiqqUVDyaQlRfhNQ--uLm_zcXCxPnVRHppu\"></figure><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Sharing the Winner &amp; Finalists</h3><p>Once the scholarship closed and the winner was chosen, it was time to share who had won! Using <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma</a> once again, current marketing intern <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-mercer-150a3a181/\">Lauren Mercer</a> designed the graphics to share the winner and finalists of the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship. That Instagram carousel can be found <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ6yZntMj2l/\">here</a>.</p><p>Each of the ten slides were created to showcase the winner, the finalists, and the stories behind their applications. The first two slides included photos and excerpts from each student, as well as specially designed figures to represent each of them. The students really appreciated their personalized caricatures!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j1b32E12Ac2JxilLYDU8BarjU6eckJ2_i70OdgZRI0cBBg36iKWo2BIqcIjr7VjiecmQz0WeR1zGTT7BjiKGVh1W8V-JqfB7OAQyyqskURxCbu4guZAimScqfJSFTdF4423ijv1L\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Yy37POfyMBuFbIhtOB7cvw7ckX_ev5AAKI7aA5ApQAqDuAANg6T7txCQ2wcqBGKhPgs8UUYRVVyCrVXaZT0z2A_NBCZ-sFPlAX8jL00cMnZQWF5e7VKJHcoAA0fAnhQr2ZgnUb6h\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The remaining slides contain photos, excerpts, and thank you messages from the winner and each finalist. Before we posted the Instagram carousel, the Skateboards for Hope team and each student had the opportunity to approve the designs and provide feedback.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gDmRcbM.jpg\"></figure><p>Fun fact: colours from the new <a href=\"https://skateboardsforhope.com/our-ambassadors/\">Skateboards for Hope website</a> were used as inspiration for the colour palette for the winner and finalists graphics!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Video</h2><p>One of our software and design interns, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelina-wu-60643a209/\">Angelina Wu</a>, created a fantastic video to showcase the talents of the winner and finalists.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the scholarship application, students were required to submit a video of themselves performing an extreme sport. Along with Skateboards for Hope, we decided that a video compilation of the winner and finalists performing their sports would be a great way to share the students' talents in a way that was unique to the first action sport scholarship in Canada!&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the video on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ9Ps0pAX_t/\">Instagram </a>and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BsgTiEwbKIc\">Youtube</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How Did We Promote the Scholarship</h2><p>When it came time to promote the Skateboards for Hope Scholarship, we relied on many strategies to ensure we reached a wide audience of students all across Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Instagram</h3><p>Beginning many weeks before the scholarship deadline, each member of the team sent at least <strong>5-10 DM’s per week</strong> to action sport organizations in their assigned region requesting that they share the scholarship with their members.&nbsp;</p><p>Many organizations, and even some high schools, were more than willing to repost the scholarship on their story or feed</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rXjuawo.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Email&nbsp;</h3><p>At the same time that we began messaging organizations through Instagram, we also began promoting through email. Each team member sent at least <strong>5-10 emails per week</strong>, on top of the Instagram DM’s, to high school and action sport organizations in their assigned region.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pub6llbj2bFZ5zxCkQo0TbmqyBlOmxvOwP5DuqHnsDXSN3-snwWOKsTdg_DctBRwU67rrog6VjPn0yh76tUxZKxftognVX6J1yz8009wzM01-GBWPVWINVYRZYYvYbDVGzJ0QBs7\"></figure><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Ads</h3><p>Check out the section on metrics further below to see just how many people we were able to reach through our Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Replies</h2><p>We received an amazing, positive response to the scholarship from high schools, university clubs, and action sports organizations across Canada.

Additionally, our ad reached more women than men at 69% to 31% respectively.</p><p>The English ad had slightly better results, as shown below, reaching a total of 1826 people while collecting 35 link clicks and a cost per result ranging from 11 cents to 42 cents in the same amount of time.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/db7ZJvBwVrm336BFIKWO-Bk972OoQLpduXo2hXkxIbognOsiDOzyzyTryRiEC1_uiVUZRF3M36KVwK1XF6rSXrbYXQq0zMUhkApAvu9jdXLyh83PBavK10mcGqJoYAk3j8Yywq7-\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eLn4l-klzBLJMBf3s_MW8xSLVuGDaFalOL93_BgNvx2QvJDBlp6ZeecZj5OSUPzY6_RNtKUtu9Th3SPtgZmFXq6xMk1WeZ9Oi59BbuMVDmYzisCm-4aa5P6ShPddtm2TjXTg9Jeq\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YlS74s3rSYLvA8eqai0LA62AMsytOTxX2yD-G-7lbXFz47JFOEXQ8jycoc6YwMQ74f_hV1tv0CTnQUQyqynGMtk2VI2gqdUZp3wSG4qrOjjfR3QoMNNLcodkwmmNRBhvK9D0WwFD\"></figure><p>Similar to the French as, Instagram was where most people saw our ad (a total of 1691 people), but more interestingly, we had a slightly more even distribution between women and men (63% female to 37% male).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Instagram</h3><p>These last two images are of our <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLKSucZsxcm/\">English </a>and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLsfLHiMOhB/\">French </a>Instagram posts to promote the Skateboards for Hope scholarship.

The only two exceptions to that is work and school.</p><p>It’s unlikely that the people you work with or go to school with all agree on what is considered offensive and what is considered socially acceptable.</p><p>To make sure everyone has a comfortable work experience it’s probably better to eliminate all the jokes that can potentially offend someone. Scott Galloway has a funny line: “once you do that all you’re left with is knock knock jokes”.</p><p>People have strong opinions on if this is a good or bad thing. But I think it’s just a function of compromises that have to be made when working with others so that everyone feels comfortable.</p><p>However, I strongly agree with Jennifer and Naomi on their point that being funny is a massive advantage in business and in life.</p><p>So really it’s all about balance. Finding the balance between being funny without being offensive is actually a very tricky balance to find. So tricky, for some people it might not even be worth the risk. Sometimes it's better to just keep your head down, do your work and maybe throw in the occasional platitude every once in a while. But if you can find that balance, it’s spectacular.</p><p>Being funny at work is like making a flambe dish. If you get it right, it’s beautiful to witness, just be careful not to burn anyone, including yourself.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Originally posted: <a href=\"https://blog.tomiwa.ca/can-you-be-funny-at-work/\">blog.tomiwa.ca/can-you-be-funny-at-work</a></p><p><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@johnathanmphoto\">Cooking Flambe Image source: Jonathan Macedo - Unsplash</a></p>",

Sit down if you know exactly what you want to do when you graduate high school and you know exactly what you need to do to get there. Look around the room, you see that more people are standing up relative to how many people are sitting down. Keep standing. Understand that if you feel like you have no idea what you want to do with your life, understand that you are not alone. Everyone that is standing up is in the same boat as you. You can sit down now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The funny part about that experiment is that even though you folks are just in high school, if I asked this question in my university class, they would probably have the same reaction. I even wonder if I asked this question in a room full of adults, I think at least 50% of people would remain standing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I say all that to say this, you are not alone. Most people don’t really have a clear idea on what they want to do with their life. Figuring out what you want to do with your life is, in my opinion, the most important question facing humanity today. Yet we don’t spend enough time talking about it. Which is why I’m here. I’m still trying to figure it out myself so I don’t have “the answer” and there is no “answer” but I’m here to share some advice on what helped me figure out what I want to do with my life and lessons learned along the way.</p><h2><strong>Who is this guy?</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, who does this guy think he is? Walks in here talking about let me help you figure out what you want to do with your life. Well let me tell you who think I am.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My name is Tomiwa and I was born in the beautiful city of Lagos in Nigeria. How many of you were born or your parents were born in a different country? Nigeria is a wonderful country and I love Nigeria, but when I turned eight years old my parents made what I consider to be the best decision for me and our family. They immigrated to Canada, what I consider to be, the land of opportunity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So we moved to Canada, in the suburbs just outside of Toronto and definitely had the prototypical immigrant childhood. My parents always valued education and that school was the&nbsp; way to success. Most of you have parents similar to mine, you can be anything you want as long as it’s a lawyer, doctor or an engineer. Just like most of you I spent hours trying to research what was the best choice for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I can’t lie to you guys. One of my biggest motivators, was 5 letter word that starts with M, does anyone know what it is? Money! I remember literally googling “best paying jobs” and “best paying degrees”. Engineering was like 6 of the 10 best paying degrees and the best paying jobs was investment banking (aka business). So I decided I would study “engineering” and “business”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I worked really hard and I got into one of the best business schools in the country, Ivey business school. I also played soccer competitively so I got a scholarship to play on the varsity soccer team. Things were looking pretty good at that time, I was playing on the varsity soccer team, I was in the perfect degree to get that investment banking job and secure the bag. Then… plot twist. I get injured. For those of you who are really good at sports or school or music etc. That thing starts to define you. Everyone knew me as “the soccer guy” so once I got injured I had to basically create a new identity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That’s when I started really reading about entrepreneurship and technology startups. Then I started thinking, wait a minute, there’s this amazing thing called the internet that is literally booming in front of us. Why am I wasting my time in school and trying to be an investment banker. So I decided to drop out of university for a year and start my own company, atila.ca, which I will talk about later. My parents as most of you can imagine, were very upset.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All my friends and family thought I was crazy, so many people were trying to change my mind, that even I started feeling like I was crazy, but I wasn’t, I was just following my heart. Follow your heart is one of those things that people call a cliche now but there’s a lot of truth to it. Maybe instead of telling people to “follow your heart”, we should say follow your truth, follow what you think is true.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, so I followed my truth and made one of the toughest decisions in my life. Looking back it’s funny how scared I was to make this decision and it ended up being one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I was the very first engineer for a startup called Properly, I travelled across Europe with my friend Val, I grew my business.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, but what does it matter? This is just one guy’s story. Well actually it’s not even about me. So I have this podcast called Atila TV and I’ve interviewed a lot of young people and I am going to share their stories with you today to help you decide what you want to do with your life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/getting-into-medical-school-without-a-degree-advice-for-pre-med-students-work-life-balance-and-self-care-emily-chen-atila-tv-001/\"><strong>Emily’s Story</strong></a></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emily was the very first guest I had on Atila TV. How many of you want to go to medical school? So Emily actually got into U of T medical school before she even graduated from university. It’s interesting because some people don’t get into medical school even after graduating from university AND doing a master’s degree, but she got into medical school without any degree and got into UofT medical school one of the best schools in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I’m sure when people find out that she got into medical school, everyone’s like “Oh Emily, you’re so smart, you’re so lucky”. Emily is a very smart and hardworking girl so all those things are true. But one thing Emily did really well which people don’t talk about enough is that she takes excellent initiative. So when she was in High school, she called every single Optometrist, Doctor, Dentist in Oakville, where she’s from and said “Hey my name is Emily, I think I’m interested in this field, do you mind if I shadow you or ask you some questions about your job”.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This does two things. One it helps you figure out if you really want to do that job. Being a doctor is extremely prestigious. How many of you are immigrants. So there’s this stereotype that all immigrants want their kids to be doctors. So by Emily shadowing doctors it helped her realize if this is truly something that she would want to do and she wasn’t just in love with the idea of it. The other thing this does is it helped her figure out the HOW. Sometimes in life it feels like there is your current position, your ending position and no idea how to get to your Goal, it’s like a <a href=\"https://scholasticadministrator.typepad.com/thisweekineducation/2010/08/cartoon-welcome-to-the-maze.html\">maze</a>. But the other benefit of talking to people who are doing what you want to be doing is you learn, How they did it. Everyone’s path is going to be slightly different but it helps you figure out how to do it.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So that’s my first lesson: find a mentor. If you think you’re interested in a certain profession. Find someone who is doing what you want to be doing and just ask if you can talk with them for 15 minutes. What you want to figure out is if you could see yourself doing what they do for a living. The second thing is you want to reverse engineer how they got there and see what steps you need to take.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two important points about this. First, this works for literally any profession. You’re probably thinking oh, I can’t do this only doctors or lawyers or accountants can do that. I’m telling you this works for any field. If you want to be a personal trainer or a carpenter, a nurse, even a Youtuber. Find someone who does that job and ask if you can follow them for a day or talk to them for 15 minutes. There are lots of tools available for you now, you don’t even have to call them anymore. Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, tools that you can talk to literally anyone in the world no matter who you are. Take advantage of these tools. Literally every single person that I am going to talk about today has an Instagram account. If any of their stories sound interesting, you can easily DM any of them. I dare you to do it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/harvard-valedictorian-basketball-captain-goldman-sachs-co-founder-of-no-more-names-criminal-justice-reform-chris-egi-atila-tv-014/\"><strong>Chris’ Story</strong></a></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next story I have is Chris Egi. Chris was my final guest for the last season of Atila TV and his story is super inspiring. Long story short this guy is good at everything. He played high school basketball with D’Angelo Rusell and Ben Simmons. How many of you know D’Angelo Rusell and Ben Simmons? Then he&nbsp; got into Havard, graduated valedictorian in his class, works at Goldman Sachs, the best investment bank in the world and also started a non-profit while fighting police brutality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I learnt a lot from that interview with Chris. The first lesson is that life is not a Netflix special, no one knows the storyline beforehand. Chris has a very blessed life, but while he was in university, he had a serious injury that caused him to retire from basketball. While all of this was happening, his father passed away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like I said earlier, he played basketball with Ben Simmons who is now in the NBA, there is a very good chance he could have gone to the NBA himself and his father to walk him across the stage when he graduates. No one could have foreseen him getting injured and no one expects their parents to pass away while they are in university.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what is most impressive is how he was able to bounce back. He ended up getting a prestigious job at one of the top banks in the country. Now he has done work with Nike and his organization was able to get Dave East and Vic Mensa to come talk at their events.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This is very important, because for most of you in this room, you have never really faced setbacks. Your life usually goes like this. Work really hard, get what you want. Work really hard, get what you want. In life things will happen that you didn’t see coming. Just remember that your life is not like a Netflix special, it’s more like a twitch or Youtube livestream. No one knows what’s going to happen but you get to decide what happens next.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/u-of-t-medical-school-mcat-for-black-students-poetry-and-womens-rights-chika-stacy-oriuwa-atila-tv-011\"><strong>Chika’s Story</strong></a></h2><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we have Chika. Chika was also a medical student like Emily. She went into both McMaster Health Science and U of T Medical School. How many of you want to go to McMaster health Science? Yeah, so you probably know that is a very difficult program to get into. Chika is an extremely focused and organized person. Just like all these other people that I mentioned. But what stood out from this interview is how she answered one question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have this question where I ask people. Where do you see yourself a year, five years and 25 years from now. So when I asked her where she sees herself in the future she had a very interesting answer. She says that she sees herself writing poetry and making movies. I was so surprised, this is someone that has been super tracked to go to medical school for over a decade and what she wants to do is write movies?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But this is the lesson. Don’t put yourself into a box. A lot of us when we’re young have a thing that we’re known for. Some of us we’re known as “the volleyball girl” or “ The student government guy”, some of us we’re known for being smart or known for being good at music. This is a great thing, it’s good to be known for being talented. This can be also end up putting ourselves in a mental prison. I just want to say to you, that we are not ants. We are not built to do one thing and one thing only. Don’t be afraid to try new things, even if it’s different from what you’re “supposed” to be doing, we’re not “supposed” to do anything. The only thing we’re “supposed” to do is to live and survive.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Hope’s Story</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Final story, for you is Hope’s story. This might be my favorite of all the stories I’ve said today and it’s the most different. So all the stories I’ve shared so far today are all people that can be called early risers. These are people that have for the most part, always been very successful at what they’ve done from a very young age. The challenge with their stories is that most people are not like that. Some people sort of just drift through life and it takes them a while to figure it out. This brings me to Hope.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>When I first met Hope, he was a skinny freshman in high school, wasn’t the best at sports, didn’t have the best grades. He had a job at Superstore, pushing carts somehow he got fired from that. I don’t know how you get fired from pushing carts at the grocery store. Anyway, so imagine this, not good at sports, not getting great grades, and he just got fired so he’s not even making any money. It’s like Dude what do you even have going for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the trick was that Hope simply needed to find out what he enjoyed doing, what his strengths were and combine that together. So the thing about Hope is that he is a very charismatic guy, the kind of person you just enjoy being around. So he started training high school kids and young kids on how to play basketball, get stronger. So literally he would just record himself working people out, put that on his Instagram page and it blew up from there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I took <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/search/_p0x60f4dd8775707432_Milton/photo/AF1QipNxwLXFAUQ7rdaks_qq7AUOWue6LphHLGiEElNE\">this picture with Hope</a>, he was on his way to do a modelling shoot for Nike and he was telling me just turned down a coaching job that would be paying him more than most of my friends who graduated from university are making.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So my final lesson to you is that don’t worry if it seems like your life is not exactly where you want it to be. Not everyone has to go to university, there is a lot of social pressure for people to go to university, but different people have different paths. I’ve found that the most important trait is work ethic and hustle. Just make sure that whatever path you decide to pick, you work very hard at it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Think of your life like a neverending season of Game of Thrones, just because the first episode isn’t great, you will still have more episodes to watch and you can still have a great season finale.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/elementary-school-teacher-and-reiki-yoga-instructor-on-self-love-mindfulness-and-education-laura-desimone-atila-tv-010\"><strong>Laura’s Story</strong></a></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So this is a final bonus story that I am going to throw in here. This story is actually not even aimed at the students but at the teachers and any parents in the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the people I interviewed is a lady called Laura DeSimone. so Laura is a teacher and she’s also a Reiki yoga instructor and I’ll never forget something she said during the interview.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Me: So Laura what is something you would tell all the teachers and parents about educating young people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Laura: That the number one job of a teacher is to teach students to love themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Me: But Laura, what about getting good grades and getting into a good school and getting a good job???</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Laura: That part will come. The only reason people don’t reach their full potential is because there’s a part of themselves they don’t love.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That conversation really stuck with me because it’s so true. We think that our jobs as educators is to teach them math or science or all these topics. This is true to an extent, but if you think about the best teachers, what they do is they give you self-confidence that you can actually accomplish the task and then it’s your brain figures out how to get it done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Final mic drop from Laura:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Me: okay, so how can teachers teach students self-love</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Laura: Well before you can teach someone else self-love, you have to love yourself.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Pay For School</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, suppose you decide to go to university or college like most of you will, it’s very important that you figure out how to pay for it. How important is this? Well let me ask you a question, how much debt do you think the average student graduates with? (Try to guess before you keep reading.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>$5,000</p><p>$10,000</p><p>$28,000</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is C. The average student graduates with about <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710003601\">$28,000</a> in student loans. Even I personally have over, $60,000 in student loans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How many of you currently have a part time job? How many of you have worked full-time before? Okay, so let me put this into context for just how much money this is. OSAP has a <a href=\"https://osap.gov.on.ca/AidEstimator1920Web/enterapp/debt_calculator.xhtml\">repayment calculator</a> that shows you how much your monthly payment is going to be when you graduate from university. So with the averages, you can expect to pay about $350 every single month for the next 10 years. To put that in context, that’s like buying 3 new iPhone 11s every single year, 30 Starbucks Frappucinnos and<a href=\"https://teslanomics.co/tesla-model-3-cost-calculator/\"> for an extra $100 a month you could even buy a Tesla</a>.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not saying this to scare you. Well actually I am. That’s exactly why I am saying this. You should be scared because it’s a lot of money. But you can use fear in a negative or positive way. The negative way is to say that you won’t go to university or you won’t do the program you want to do or you try to avoid thinking about it until you can't avoid it any longer and start then you get anxiety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The positive way to use this fear is to start thinking hard about how you’re going to pay for it and come up with a plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How Atila.ca gets you money for school</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know this because I also have this fear, I currently have over $68,000 in student loans because I attend the most expensive undergrad program in Canada. However, I chose to use this fear in a positive way to help people like you and me pay for school and start <a href=\"https://atila.ca/\">atila.ca</a> to help students pay for their education.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>I really encourage you all to check it out when you get home. The idea is very simple: You make an account and enter what school and program you are interested in. The algorithm then helps you find all the scholarships that match your profile. So for example, I go to Western university and study engineering, so the algorithm automatically finds me all the scholarships that are for students at Western University and who study engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This is very important because there’s a lot of scholarships out there. In fact, about $5 million that goes unused every year. So having a system that filters and sorts all these scholarships for you will save you a lot of time. And make sure that you maximize the amount of money you get because you will need every dollar you can get.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The next part is the application process. So even after you’ve found the scholarship that you like, it still takes a long time to apply for scholarships. So many questions will ask you, oh what do you want to do after you graduate from school. Then you think to yourself, I already answered this question, I wish there was a way for me to reuse an answer I’ve already used. So with Atila you can do that. You answer a question once and anytime a similar question is being asked, it automatically fills in for you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So the algorithm is smart enough to know that if one scholarship asks, “What are your career plans after you graduate?” and another question asks “What career would you like to have?” the algorithm knows that it is a similar question and will automatically prefill it for you. Imagine how much time this can save you.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>There’s another really cool thing which Atila can do. So there’s this really annoying thing about scholarships where one scholarship will say, what do you want to do when you graduate (700 words). Then another scholarship will say, what do you want to do when you graduate (500 words). Now you have to figure out how to rewrite the entire application using 200 words.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>With Atila, you no longer have to worry about all that. If you’ve answered the same or even a similar question, Atila will find that question and autofill the question for you. Then, if you need to reduce the word count our algorithm will automatically reduce the word count for you.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This is important because the less time you spend answering the same questions over and over again, this gives you back your most valuable asset, Time. You now have more time to apply for more scholarships, work a part time job, study more or even just relaxing.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>So like I said, the average student is going to graduate with about $28,000 in student loans. You should be scared by that number because it is a lot of money. But remember to use that fear in a positive way, to motivate you to think hard about how you will pay for school and make a plan.</p><p><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There’s been a lot of information I’ve covered here today so I want to summarize the 5 key points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to know exactly what you want to do with your life. But to get a better idea of what interests you, you need to develop self awareness. All the information I’ve given today is completely useless if you don’t develop self-awareness and figure out what YOU want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Think of your purpose as a venn diagram of what makes money, what you enjoy and what you’re good at. You should be able to at least figure out what you enjoy and what you’re good at. Once you know those two, don’t worry society will let you know very quickly what makes money.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some ways to develop self awareness:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Talk to people who have what you want and try to figure out if they are happy with their life and if your personality would be happy doing what they do<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Take a personality test. not because they are accurate but because they may reveal things about yourself: Big 5 and Myers-Briggs are common ones<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Journal or do a private video diary of your thoughts. A week, a month and a year later revisit it to see what your thought process was like.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Find someone you trust and ask them to psychoanalyze you. Ask them to be brutally honest with you and what they think your biggest strengths and weaknesses are.</p><p>Experiment, treat your life like a mini-science experiment. If you think you might like something, think of the smallest experiment you can run to figure out if you actually like it or you just like the “idea” of it and test your hypothesis.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, school is very expensive. Some of you will owe about $30,000 when you graduate. If this scares you it’s not a bad thing. Fear is fuel and it can be good or bad depending on how you use it. When you put in on wood it burns a house down, when you put it in your lamborghini, it can go over 300 km/h. The same fuel that can burn down everything you’ve built. You can take that exact same fuel and use it to take you places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So take that fear use it as fuel and put it in your Lamborghini. Finally, remember your life is not a Netflix Special. It's a Youtube livestream. No one knows how your movie ends, but only you can control what happens next.</p>",

[24:50]</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Why Harvard? [24:50]</p>\n<p>Chris Egi: I didn&rsquo;t want to go to Harvard at first. As a young kid and as basketball got more serious, I wasn&rsquo;t sure that Harvard would be best for my basketball career and also I was a bit rebellious like my parents wanted me to go to Harvard, I wanted to be my own guy. So, I saw Harvard as an option but like realistically I&rsquo;m not going there because you know I want to hoop at a high level. I&rsquo;m not watching Harvard on TV, I'm watching these other schools on TV. Some of these schools were recruiting me and that's where I want to go.</p>\n<p>What ended up helping me make the Harvard decision was the coaches really cared about me as a person, I think that was the main thing. I ended up going to my Harvard visit as my first official visits. So, I scheduled 5 official visits, Havard, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Cal Berkeley and University of Washington and I was planning a couple of other schools. Harvard was my first visit and I met the guys on the team, I really liked the guys on the team. Then me and coach Tommy Amaker, who is like a father figure to me now, I really have the utmost respect for him as a person. We sat in a room and gave me his vision for basketball and how like when coach Krzyzewski came to recruit him, they were building something but they weren&rsquo;t a high profile team at Duke but they were on to something and they thought having someone like that on the team would help get them to the next level and felt the same way about me. Beyond that, he seemed like a genuine dude that if I gave him the next four years of my life, I wouldn&rsquo;t regret it.</p>\n<h2>&ldquo;Advice for Getting into Harvard University&rdquo; [30:40]</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Harvard is probably one of the best schools in the world. If someone says to you, &ldquo;Chris I want to go to Harvard or a top Ivey League school&rdquo; what advice would you give them? [30:40]</p>\n<p>Chris: It&rsquo;s a transformative experience... I feel like you should set your goals on being the type of person that you think would get into Harvard. I feel like Harvard tries their best to cultivate a class of special human beings and I think your focus should be less on getting into Harvard and just focus on being a better person. Whether that&rsquo;s learning more, focusing on your academics, become a more well rounded by academics, sports, extracurriculars, giving back to your community. I think if you do all that stuff with the right intentions and the intention is not necessarily going to Harvard bust just being a better you. I was like &ldquo;Yeah I would love to get into Harvard&rdquo; but you know a lot of the things that got me into Harvard, I did independent of a focus on getting into Harvard. I was like &ldquo;I want to be the best basketball player I can be, I want to be the top student in my class&rdquo;. I think setting those types of personal goals is important. Focus on &ldquo;This is something I really love and I want to excel at this&rdquo;. I think that&rsquo;s the type of stuff that will get you into Harvard.</p>\n<h2>How did you get the Jobs at Bain and Goldman [1:12:15]</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa: Bain and Goldman, how did this job opportunities come about?</p>\n<p>Chris: They both came about through campus recruiting. So Goldman was funny because I was actually looking for a summer job in Toronto. I didn&rsquo;t really know much. I didn't know what Goldman was, a few of my friends had applied. So I was looking for a summer job in toronto on the school campus page. And I thought &lsquo;Oh, Goldman has an opportunity in Toronto. I go through the application process, I get an interview. I remember after hearing that I got an interview for an investment banking role, I called my cousin who had worked at GOldman previously and was like &ldquo;So What&rsquo;s investment banking&rdquo;. [laughs]</p>\n<p>I had no clue. It was a real period of&hellip; I had to learn quick. I ended up being fortunate to get the offer. Then when I got the offer I realized it was a NEw York position. I was like &ldquo;Oh It&rsquo;s not in Toronto. I remember being on the phone with my mom I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to take this. She was like what do you mean you&rsquo;re not going to take this. You&rsquo;re going to take this. We can figure out the basketball later. This is a special opportunity. I wanted to be in Toronto to be with my trainer. I&rsquo;m grateful I made that choice.</p>\n<p>The Bain opportunity. It&rsquo;s a program called <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/careers/bel/\">BEL</a> and it&rsquo;s basically an opportunity to do a weeklong summer program during your sophomore program to learn more about consulting. I really enjoyed my experience, I worked in the LA office for a week. I found out about it through friends, I applied. Similar thing honestly. I had no clue what management consulting really was until I applied. I learned that they do these things called Case interviews, I learnt how to do a case interview a day before the interview. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate, God has blessed me, I&rsquo;ve been lucky, hard work meets opportunity. Whatever you want to call it.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to get those two internships. Once you get them, it&rsquo;s a grind and you just work hard. I was training for basketball this time. I was getting up at 5:30, work out from 6-7:30. Get into the office from 8:30-9. In the office from 9-midnight. Up at 5:30 the next day getting your basketball work and doing it again. I was also doing two-a-days, so I was working out at night. It&rsquo;s definitely a grind.</p>\n<h2>Chris Egi on Losing His Father and how it Changed his Life [1:32:20]</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: You mentioned that you&rsquo;re comfortable talking about this so whatever you feel comfortable saying, feel free to talk about it. Your father passing away, what impact did that have on you. If you don&rsquo;t mind, whatever you&rsquo;re comfortable sharing, essentially what happened and how did that impact you?</p>\n<p>Chris Egi: He had liver cancer. Won&rsquo;t talk too much about that component about it&hellip;</p>\n<p>Tomiwa: Both when he was alive and when he passed away.</p>\n<p>Chris: My dad was a hero to me. He came to Canada when he was 16 with nothing. Delivered pizzas to pay his way through college, was the definition of a hustler. Made his way from nothing and was able to send his kids to really good schools. He was the type of guy to never say no.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A story that epitomizes my dad and was recently told me. My sister and myself, when we finished kindergarten were going to go to a private school. My older brother in 3rd grade at the neighborhood catholic school, my parents had planned to maybe send him to a private school in 9th grade for high school, that would be more affordable. My brother, he&rsquo;s a smart kid, comes up with an explanation on why he should go to private school as well. &ldquo;Because I want to learn just like my brother and sister. I want to be able to go to a good university, because it will help me get a good job and change my life and the life of my family. Like a 3rd grade kid talking crazy. At that my moment my brother had no clue that&hellip; I honestly can&rsquo;t speak to what the financial situation was but that&rsquo;s an extra sum of money that people not planning for. It&rsquo;s very easy to say &ldquo;we understand that, maybe later&rsquo;. My dad is not the type of guy to say no to someone. He&rsquo;s the type of guy to say &ldquo;yes and say okay now I have to work extra hard to figure it out&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s the type of person who sacrificed a lot for me to live the dreams that I&rsquo;m living right now. What I struggled with initially after his passing is the idea he never got to enjoy the fruit of his hard work.&nbsp; Because He spent his whole life working to set us up. Now that he set us up he can just be happy. But taken away before that can happen. But what I&rsquo;ve come to terms with, his dream is us. For me, you dream you dream, you dream. I write on my Instagram. I am my father&rsquo;s legacy, I am my father&rsquo;s dream. I am the living embodiment of that. SO when I go out everyday into the world. What I stand for, who I am what I work for is a representation of my father and his legacy</p>\n<h2>Why Chris Started No More Names: &ldquo;Police Brutality is something I&rsquo;ve always cared about&rdquo; [1:22:50]</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Tell us more about <a href=\"https://10000voices.nomorenames.co\">No More Names</a> and why you started it. [1:22:50]</p>\n<p>Chris Egi: So No more Names came about because police brutality is something that I&rsquo;ve always cared about. Like I said Michael Brown was killed before I came to college, Trayvon Martin was killed when I move to the US, Eric Garner was killed when I came to college and when I first got to college, I saw these protests. I participated in some of these protests and from college I would speak about it, tweet about it, always thought it was unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But you know I feel like I would like to talk about it, I would write about it. I wrote some poems et cetera. But when senior year came and basketball finished. Setphon Clarke got killed an initial police reports said he got shot 20 times. It was like &lsquo;You shot him 20 times&rsquo;? I was like let&rsquo;s do something. Me and my roommate were literally chilling in the dining hall and I was like, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do something&rdquo;. The previous year we had run fundraise for a woman with cancer called thank you black Woman. Okay let&rsquo;s run a fundraiser like a benefit concert. My friends like you know that&rsquo;s a lot of work right. And.. it ended up being a lot of work!</p>\n<p>I had no event experience. But thankfully I had immense support from the administration at Harvard, immense support from a great team of people. Also, interesting enough, right at that time we decided to do this, a Harvard student was beaten by the police. Which raised the stakes to another level. We ended up being fortunate enough to bring in Vic Mensa, he performed and spoke. We raised a bit over $7,000 for the event. That was the start of no more names. The idea that Stephon Clarkes was just another name on this name.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most black people can recite a list of names. Miraise[spelling?], Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Walter Scott, Oscar Grant, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland. Like a long list of people. I want my kids to grow up in a world where there are no more names. That&rsquo;s the kind of impetus for the organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This past year, after we ran the event. I fell asleep on my friend&rsquo;s floor I was so tired. I was like we could do this at other places too. That was the idea, we ran events at Harvard this year, Princeton, Brown with meg The Stallion, Dartmouth with Roy Woods, Columbia with Anton Thomas and Emerald Garner, Yale with Dave East and Anton Thomas. We ran all these events, it's just a matter of connecting students with the issue. We had a national day of remembrance in February where people would share their stories the names of victims.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just yesterday we helped organize a memorial event in Harlem. I had the privilege of getting close with Emerald Garner. One of the most impressive people I have ever met, she&rsquo;s just a special person. We&rsquo;ve been trying to help her out with her quest for justice. We hope to spread our work to more schools and connect more students with more organizations doing good work. We can be a bridge between young people and work that&rsquo;s being done. Or student volunteers that want to help but don&rsquo;t know where to start. I think it's been some of the most important work that I&rsquo;ve done in my life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What Was it Really Like Playing Basketball with Ben Simmons and D&rsquo;Angelo Russell [7:00]&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tomiwa: One thing you were mentioning about being competitive, I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by successful people, what they were like when they were younger. D&rsquo;Angelo Russell and Ben Simmons, take us behind the scenes. What were they like when they were still coming up?</p>\n<p>Chris: D&rsquo;Angelo was just a natural leader. He just had a natural charisma to him where you didn&rsquo;t want to let him down. It&rsquo;s funny because you two are the same age but you kind of look up to him. People on the team gravitated towards his energy. He was a fun guy to be around, a little bit of a goofball. But he was a winner at heart and he was a competitor. He never wanted to lose anything.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He had an extreme confidence in himself which I think is why people gravitate towards him. He thought he was the best player on the court every time he played. If you have a player on your team who&rsquo;s like that you feel like the best player on the court. He&rsquo;d come up to you before games loosen up, we need you out there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I enjoyed playing with him, he was a great passer to. I remember we had this one game on ESPN and he was like just Run bro and I&rsquo;ll make sure you have a good game. I had 20 points and all of them were off his assists. He&rsquo;s a very good player in terms of that.</p>\n<p>Ben, when he was in high school he was a special guy. For a guy who was so talented he was just a normal dude. That&rsquo;s something you really appreciate. He also had confidence in himself, like a quiet confidence in himself. Everybody kind of knows he&rsquo;s ben Simmons, he knows he&rsquo;s Ben Simmons so we just don&rsquo;t need to discuss. He&rsquo;s the type of guy you loved to play with. He made you feel important. He&rsquo;d chat with you in a way that you feel like you&rsquo;re a big part of the team and that was really special.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re two really special young men and I&rsquo;m so happy to see the success that they&rsquo;ve had. I&rsquo;m always rooting for them.</p>\n<h2>From St. Andrew&rsquo;s College to Montverde Prep Academy [7:00]</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa: How do you go from St. Andrew&rsquo;s college in America to this, Ben Simmons and D&rsquo;Angelo Russel at Montverde? [7:00]</p>\n<p>Chris: St. Andrew&rsquo;s was a great experience for me, that&rsquo;s where I learned how to play basketball, those coaches were real fundamental to me for development and then i started playing a little bit outside of school on OBA teams, Ontario Basketball Association teams called St. Davids and then I played for bounce for AAU afterwards and team Ontario team Canada all that stuff.</p>\n<p>As I started to play for this high profile teams for example bounce we played in the EYBL which is like a Nike league, like a lot of college coaches come. You know I played pretty well at a few Nike events and you know the coaches started to hear my name and come up as a player out of Canada that could be a good fit for the team and I started to get noticed in terms of rankings etc</p>\n<p>So, they saw me playing and saw that I would be a good fit for the team. They had just won a national championship the year before, so that&rsquo;s how I found out who they were because they beat St Benedicts. In the championship game guy, Jaylin Patterson, hit a buzzer beater three. I&rsquo;m like oh who is this? Ben Simmons just came over from Australia, I think he played in that tournament. So it was like, they were up and coming and then they win the national championship. Then got a call from the coaches, they want me in school, you know I applied. Anytime you get the chance to play for a&nbsp; coach like Boyle. He coached Ben, D&rsquo;Angelo, Kyrie Irving, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Joel Embiid, this guy is the goat of high school coaches.</p>\n<p>I was like I wanted to play professional basketball, it really hurt me to leave St. Andrews because that's where I kind of grew up, I was there from 7th grade to 11th grade, I like lived there basically, I learned how to play basketball there, had my first girlfriend while I was there. All that stuff from becoming a boy to a man went through that process there with a select group of friends.It was tough for me to leave home and move all the way to Florida but like I said I had a passion for basketball and I thought it would be the best opportunity for that.</p>",

Why do you want to be a lawyer? [7:37]</p>\n<p>Del: I feel like education would be good. Well, ok, I guess, would I say 3 reasons. First is education is important. I want to know something and not just feel like I know it. I want to go to school and&nbsp; be like ok I&rsquo;ve done enough courses and this is why I feel I&rsquo;m comfortable with this set material. Learning anything you can build a skill set in which you can transfer over to anything else, like you know discipline, perseverance, resilience, all these kinds of skills. The other thing I would say is networking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know if there is a better place you can meet like minds like university, especially, like a guitarist I work with a lot, his name is Chris Oday, shoutout Chris Oday. I met him at western, we were both Sophs, the volunteering program where you help a lot of first years get into university culture and stuff. We were both sophs, we met and we have been performing since. And we still perform together now. It is interesting to me just looking back and thinking would I have met someone who does this outside of university or would I have been able to build a relationship? I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And even from the people we know, like our mutuals,&nbsp; people who play music or are into it I don&rsquo;t know if we would have done those things if we were at other universities, doing other things. That&rsquo;s something I saw with hindsight but looking back I feel like looking back on it, it was a very good decision as it pertains to music.</p>\n<h2>Who you listening to or influenced by?</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun:What are you listening to right now? What are some of your influences musically? [19:05]</p>\n<p>Del: Have you heard of Anderson Paak? I listen to him a bunch, not the most, but he is probably my biggest influence as far as&nbsp; a performer. I saw him at echo beach, he was here with J.Cole a while back. But I saw him before that, I saw him with a, I think it was called Manifesto, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. I saw Daniel Caesar that day, I saw Katryn Nata and I saw Anderson Paak. Those guys were good. Katryn Nata, that was the first time I saw a DJ perform at that level, like I&rsquo;ve seen good DJs before but it was more like you know a chill vibe. I was like this guys is a legit artist, this is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: What do you like about Katryn Nata and Anderson Paak?</p>\n<p>Del: Katryn Nata, his sound. It just sounds so, like I like house music and dance music and stuff like that. But he takes it to another level, its that original thing. I haven't heard everything he has done. At the mainstream top tier level, I haven&rsquo;t heard anyone do this sound and break new grounds like the way this guy does.</p>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Anderson Paak?</p>\n<p>Del: Best performer I have ever seen. In my mind, Michael Jackson, Andersoon Paak,</p>\n<p>Jacob Munene: Really he is up there with Michael Jackson?</p>\n<p>Del: Aghhh not up there. I feel like its Michael Jackson and then a lot of space, a lot of wind then we have Anderson Paak.</p>\n<h2>How to Break Out In tThe Music Industry</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: If someone thinks they want to be a musician but they sort of struggle with, how can I break out? How can I put myself out there? Do you have any advice for them? [33:44}</p>\n<p>Del: Ok, there are two ways to do it, if you are in the big city or somewhere close to Toronto, you have to put it on yourself to go into the spaces where you want to perform at. Talk to the people who are organizing things, network with them, see what's possible. Even in university, I would talk to some people who I knew were good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And I would ask them, ok why haven&rsquo;t you put out anything? Not the right time, or I haven&rsquo;t gotten the right song or I&rsquo;m not sure how I would do X,Y and Z. And to me, sometimes I think I have an advantage of not knowing how tough it would be on a day to day. Because, before I had even any kind of connection, I was just looking online , is there any music place close to oakville. I found one, I went to talk to them, they put me in contact with an engineer. I had already written my first EP by then, I recorded it there and I dropped it on soundcloud.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through there I was able to meet some producers on soundcloud. I asked if they want to work. Worked with a couple from there, then I got more beats for my second EP. You see and things just kept scaling up. At the same time I kept doing shows. I&rsquo;m not even stressing myself or killing myself about how I can be the best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is just one small thing and the next and the next and looking at what can I do in this space that I am in. You have to do that in real time in real life like network with real people.</p>\n<h2>Outside of Music What Inspires You?</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: So what kind of stuff is inspiring you right now, even beyond music. What kind of stuff are you finding inspirational right now? [46:10]</p>\n<p>Del: Anime, I am very very big anime fun. It is the best stories I have ever seen. The reason I say that is they are not limited by anything. What you can imagine is what you can create. If it is like real life, you can&rsquo;t really do everything or make it look believable. What have I seen that's amazing?</p>\n<p>Full Metal Alchemist phenomenal, Hunter x Hunter ridiculous, Cowboy Bebop. And these series break ground in the sense that, not only has there been a show like them before, it mixes things in a show that has never been brought together. There is this anime called Samurai Champloo that brought together hip-hop and samurai sword fighting that whole thing. It was like the early 2000s when I watched that. And i was like WHAT? This is Jay Dilla, New Jobs on some anime stuff and the level of detail, the care, the way the story progresses, you really get sucked into the thing super quick. It is easy to get emotionally invested, so that is a big inspiration for me.</p>\n<h2>25 Year Plan</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Where would you like to be 25 years from now? [1:03:25]</p>\n<p>Del: If music goes the way I think it can go and I hope it does go. Then I want to have my own label and I want to be in the music industry. I can see myself as an executive, because there are somethings I know for the rest of my life, I won&rsquo;t lose, like the passion for music and the passion for real and tangible things.Saying these things is much easier said than done, but if I manage to make a success of myself like Jay Z, Drake or whatever, build a brand make a label. Then it becomes can I identify talent putting in the same things I was doing when I was doing on the come up myself.</p>\n<p>And I feel like that is something I can do. Even going to Western and watching people like, he has it, she has it, I can see it from the way they [carry themselves]. It doesn&rsquo;t take much, even talking to some of these people, I was like ok, funnily enough, I haven&rsquo;t done anything much in the industry but they look at me as someone who has done something. In the release, I have put stuff out, but numbers wise I haven&rsquo;t gotten anywhere near as crazy as I could. It&rsquo;s coming.So, when I spoke to them about their dreams and aspirations, I was able to guide some people and say oh you thinking of this, this is what I did when I was in that position.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And I was like huh, I really enjoy this part of the process. Not that I have to spend all my time coaching people through things but if it was like, I had like say 5-10 artists. I&rsquo;m trying to watch how they navigate their different industries and their different niches. I feel that is something I can do really, really well, but then that's a long term thing so, we&rsquo;ll see how that one goes.</p>",

You were getting older now. You got to figure out what you want to do with your life. [3:15]</p>\n<p>Will: I think I was late to the game, I think it only clicked summer of grade 11 I that was the first really hard job I had. I have done a lot of labor work but I worked at this construction site and saw how tough it can be going into grade 12. To realize how lucky I had it to that point but up until that point, I was free and clear, I had it figured out already.</p>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: You said it changed you for the rest of your life, it changed you in what way?</p>\n<p>Will: I mean it was a little extreme but I went to the point of writing on my doorway 10 months of work will equal a lifetime of opportunity. I was dead set on making sure that I did not end up in some of the jobs I had worked that summer.</p>\n<h2>What made you start a company with your friends?</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Tell us about why did you decide to start a company with your friends. [27:20]</p>\n<p>Will: Yeah, very dangerous obviously but I mean. The biggest thing is you have to have the same values and compliment skills. So, like we kind of look similar in some ways but internally very different&nbsp; and you can trust them. Start ups are a game of snakes and ladders, so you have to really build trust with who you are working with for the next five years. If not friend then close colleagues.</p>\n<h2>Backpacking Through Southeast Asia</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: So you sold your company and decided to go backpacking through Asia. Tell us why you&nbsp; went backpacking &hellip; to find yourself. [32:07]</p>\n<p>Will: Very cliche. Well I think part of the honest answer is I hadn&rsquo;t done a lot of traveling to date. I think I was a little bit burnt out. When you work as close to as hard as you can for the good part of 3 years, you got to take a break.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;You become more wise too, making sure every 3 months you get a week off and make sure you disconnect and decompress or else it just gets worse and the burn out eats at you over the months and years and you can kind of tell when people are burnt out, you don&rsquo;t see that light or fire in their eyes, thats burn out, that&rsquo;s on the fringe of burn out. Even around the office I encourage folks to take a break.</p>\n<h2>How to get investors for your business&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: So, personally a lot of my friends are thinking of starting a company. I think sometimes they think about {capital} too soon , rather than thinking about actually making something some people want. If I want to start a company today, how can I find investors? [43:00]</p>\n<p>Will: We slowly built our networks of folks, anytime we were introduced to someone we added them to our advisor list. We built up this advisor list, we built up this advisor list of 50-100 people that kept tracking our progress periodically and we kept growing the company and then they would get interested and reach out&nbsp; and things would continue to pick up. DMZ great or one eleven, these are the best places in Canada to find folks that are interested. There is maple leaf angels, crunchbase is great, angel list is great, there is a platform called nfx guild and signal, its all of the VCs in the US.</p>\n<h2>Exercise and Diet while Being an Entrepreneur</h2>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: You were talking about exercise and you are a pretty fit guy. Something I am really into is exercise and diet. So what is your exercise routine on a good week. [59:35]</p>\n<p>Will: I&rsquo;ll turn this back on you, do you have your exercise and diet dialed?</p>\n<p>Tomiwa Ademidun: I think I am at the best place I&rsquo;ve been ever, In highschool I was playing a lot of sports but I think that was a lot of youthful energy. Getting me through. Now, I got a good regiment but Ialso want to try to make it better. So, I&rsquo;m trying to see where I can improve.</p>\n<p>Will: I think it's about the right balance, if you have a tough week be ok to not do as much just as long as you can get back into the routine. I used to try and work out 5 times a week and I found you keep to such a strict routine that you&rsquo;ll just break.</p>\n<p>Now in the summer, I bike to and from work that's about half an hour each way. Then basketball once a week and runs.</p>",

I am curious to know, did you grow or change in a negative way between highschool and university? [12:27]</p><p>Chika: Ya, I would hope that everyone made some kind of development it is such a crucial age. For a lot of people it is their first time where you are away from home, or even if you still live at home, there is a certain amount of independence you get within the home.</p><p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Specifically how do you think you changed?</p><p>Chika: I came to an understanding of my own convictions and my own values and that is when a sense of my own advocacy started to ramp up. There certain things I noticed I wanted to start to advocate for, like women’s reproductive rights was something that I knew, in high-school having a catholic upbringing and going to a catholic elementary school, there were certain narratives and values.</p><p>That were embedded within the curriculum and within the culture of my highschool and when I finally got out of that I started attending education that wasn’t religiously bound. I’d kind of developed a free sense of thought and being able to think and form my own opinions, so that for me was real crucial in university.</p><h2>Explaining what BSAT is</h2><p>Tomiwa Ademidun: The other question I was going to ask, so you were talking about uoft medical school. One of the things I really respect about is, especially since I have experienced the same thing to or most of my life, Ii was maybe the token black guy, so class of 500 maybe 1 or 2 black people. One thing I really respect about you is the fact that you had this problem and you tried to solve it through the BSAT, so could you tell us more about the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://applymd.utoronto.ca/black-student-application-program\">BSAP</a>&nbsp;and why you started that program? [20:59]</p><p>Chika: Sure I did not start the BSAP program, it was well in the works before I got into medical school. That is kind of a misconception that people know that I am an ambassador for it and that the year it came out was also the year that I did a lot of publicity for the program so people make that connection and think that I started it but in fact like, I have to give the ownership to black faculty at uoft who made it all possible.</p><p>These faculty members, for years were trying to bring about this program because they realized that there was a chronically low number of black medical students. I just had the extreme honor and privilege of being able to, I kind of call it like a harmonious alignment. Because the year I was the only black medical student, was the year they were bringing out BSAP, so it was perfect to pair my narrative with their cause because it was a shining example of why we needed the cause so I had the exceptional privilege to speak to the program, about the program and being able to educate people in the media, in person, at talks and stuff like that</p><p>And just trying to dispel a lot of the myths about the BSAP program. So what it is, is the Black student application program and essentially to boil it down. It is a seperate application stream for black students. Where we are just trying to attract more black applicants. It is not a quota based system, we are not lowering the standards. They need to get the exact same criteria as the mainstream students, same GPA, MCAT scores, same extracurriculars.</p><p>Everything needs to be the exact same. It is just that we integrate individuals from the black community into the file reviewing process as well as the interviewing process, so that you can alleviate that implicit bias that is there inherently and that black individuals can feel safe and comfortable throughout the entire trajectory of medical school from the day they submit their application, to their interview, to when they are accepted and have that continued arc of support for black students, so it is sort of like a magnet stream.</p><h2>Advice for getting into medical school</h2><p>Tomiwa Ademidun: Knowing what you know now, Lets says for a young Chika who thinks they want to go to medical school. What is something you can do to increase your chance of getting into medical school? [28:05]</p><p>Chika: Find a mentor, that is the single best piece of advice I can give to someone and it is so hard in the black community because there are so few black physicians, it is hard to get access to a black mentor. You do not have to have a black mentor, but what I am saying is that you gain mentorships through a certain connection, whether it is family or whether it is close family friends.</p><p>If you are black 9 times out of 10 your family is going to be black as well. In my case neither of my parents knew a researcher that I could do research with but a lot of the people I went to school with, they had a certain connection whether its family or family friends who knew someone who could take them under their wing.</p><h2>Finding time for poetry and creative endeavors while being a medical student</h2><p>Tomiwa Ademidun: One thing I find interesting is people who are really analytical want to tap into their creative side. How do you find time to write poetry and pursue your creative endeavors while balancing your medical school? [43:28]</p><p>Chika: Oh gosh, Honestly, it has been so hard. To be entirely honest with you, it’s been so challenging. I find that it is the only thing that balances me and gives me energy to continue to do medicine. Because medicine could be very all consuming and it could be something that drains you naturally and I needed something that fills me back up. Poetry fills me, writing fills me, advocating and public speaking these things fill me. So for me it is a method of self-preservation. I sometimes write in the middle of the night when I should be sleeping, I write in the early morning, I write late at night, I write at odd hours, when I just finished a 26 hour shift. I’ll go home and feel the most inspired to write.</p>",

How do you develop that sort of relationship with people. - [ 53.25]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Laura De Simone: Because you kind of separate yourself from your emotions, right, like reiki is like, when people think of reiki. They think it&rsquo;s just moving energy through a person&rsquo;s body, but reiki practiced, like someone who really practices reiki, takes on another way of life. Where it includes meditating and includes constantly working on yourself and shedding of yourself of negative patterns and as you do that you become really sensitive to other people.

Because of you think about raising self-loving people, what the impact of that might be, the only reason a person does not reach their full potential is because there is a part of themselves they do not love, that they do not believe in. They have a limiting belief or a limiting thought to some sort of fear. A truly self-loving person have that right? Knows how to combat those fears and knows how to mitigate them. They are really self-aware and they know how that I&rsquo;m not doing this right now because I&rsquo;m afraid and they know what to do with that fear and that&rsquo;s what a truly self-loving person does. I truly believe if all we ever taught kids was how to be self-loving, they would reach their full potential. - [28:37]</p>\n</div>",

At that time I was very ambitious, I think I&rsquo;ve always been ambitious I always wanted to solve problems and do things very grand. So reeling that back it was me saying hey I want to solve the electricity problem in Nigeria. That was me.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I remember clearly before I left Nigeria to come to Canada I was like I&rsquo;m going to solve this problem. So at that age, that was my main focus, my life mission: go to university, get all the skills, learn, come back to your country and improve it; electricity was one of the problems I felt like I could solve which is the reason why I went into electrical and computer engineering.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So at that time I was obviously naive I didn&rsquo;t think about how I was going to get into it, but I think it&rsquo;s nice to be curious, adventurous and ambitious and have this grand idea. You have something to look forward to you have something to work towards and you&rsquo;re able to adapt to the changes that happen which is essentially what I did. Sefunmi at 16 was less knowledgeable but still as ambitious.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"why-did-you-decide-to-study-in-canada\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">Why did you decide to study in Canada?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: I actually wanted to go to the US, I wanted to go to MIT. That was my number one choice. My dad didn&rsquo;t like the idea of going to the states, I don&rsquo;t know why, I haven&rsquo;t really talked to him about it. I didn&rsquo;t want to go to the UK. That one for sure I knew I wasn&rsquo;t interested in, I just didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Then I started reading about Waterloo and this core program. I think the biggest thing that was intriguing to me was you can work while going to school and you do 4 months of school 4 months of work and you can get paid. So right when I was in Nigeria I was like I want to go to Waterloo. I also didn&rsquo;t get into MIT. So I was like Waterloo, that was my goal.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"how-did-you-get-the-job-at-apple\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">How did you get the job at Apple?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: I wrote an article. Honestly, I know everyone&rsquo;s going to be like- but honest to God. I&rsquo;ll tell you the reason why I said that. There are a lot of fortunate experiences that you have that help your stars align in a way so I think that&rsquo;s what just happened. I always wanted to work for apple.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">My first year I remember when I was in residence I was talking to a couple of friends and we were just applying for jobs and I was like how cool would it be to get a job at apple? It was always something I always wanted to do. The time when I decided I wanted to chase that project I had 2 co-ops left. For that one I got the one in Microsoft and before that I wanted to go to California.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So more so my interviews were about the California companies and I went to apples info session and I met someone there. I met him there and we talked and I gave him my resume, Michael. So I gave him my resume but I didn&rsquo;t hear back. I got a another different apple interview but that was for software broadband. But I think the best so far I got then was Microsoft. Microsoft was great. When I went back to school I was like I want to try for Apple again, that was where my mind was at. And I knew a friend of mine who worked in Apple he was in product operations, which I eventually got and he was telling me about the role and the people that were there and I was like this seems cool I wanna do this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">And then I went to the info session and I see the guy that I saw before like two terms ago collecting resumes in line, and as I was just about to talk to him my friend that I spoke to pulls up and she was like &ldquo;hey Michael this is my friend Sefunmi&rdquo;. He was like hey man I remember you from last time where did you end up going? I was like oh Microsoft. I gave him my resume and we started talking. And he was like oh, sounds cool blah blah. I go home.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Typically in that info session if you get an interview you get a card. He didn&rsquo;t give me a card. I just went home and was like whatever. I get a text from him like hey it&rsquo;s Michael from Apple I really enjoyed talking to you do you have time tomorrow for an interview? I was like of course I have time for an interview. I kid you not that night I literally read everything I knew about the discussion we had, I just tried to pull up a bunch of things- this is also what I mean your fortunate experiences so one of the last few things that I read happened to be what they asked me in the interview so I had a 30 minute interview with him I was the last person they interviewed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">They interviewed 16 people that day, I was the last person they interviewed. We chatted and he asked me a bunch of questions and I answered them. It seemed okay. The next day I get an email a couple of days later about second rounds. And my second round was with a guy named Tosi, who&rsquo;s Nigerian. I was like &ldquo;God,&rdquo; like literally, this is what I mean by your stars align. But funny story that interview was actually way harder than the first one. I thought it would be a breeze. I asked my friend Cindy what do you know about Tosi and she said he&rsquo;s great. I had this interview and this man grills me. Every possible design question ever, like hardware design not even general product design. He was asking me and I was just trying on the spot.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">And the interview ends I&rsquo;m like this was supposed to be a 30 minute interview it lasted an hour, I&rsquo;m like sweating. He was like I enjoyed talking to you where are you from? I was like oh I&rsquo;m from Lagos. Ranking day, they typically reach out to you earlier on to give you an offer but it didn&rsquo;t get out to me. So it was the day when rankings came out, rankings is when they let you know the official match with which one you&rsquo;re going to be and I see Apple offer. I was like like, God. Fell down immediately, bruised my elbow I was bleeding but I was like I don&rsquo;t care. I was astonished. It was a great term. I was very busy, very hardworking I think that&rsquo;s where I build the work ethic I have today because I worked there. So that&rsquo;s my Apple story.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So it&rsquo;s a whole lot of fortunate experiences. People fail to recognize there&rsquo;s stuff that they have to do. They have to do research and study. Those things you still have to do but here are other things that are out of your control that you need to be able to look up, like this is fate, or this is God if you believe in God.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: I respect that, so some things were out of your control and some things were in your control. So let&rsquo;s focus on things that were in your control. Looking back, and I know people are going to be very modest but try and be as honest as possible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"how-did-you-prepare-for-the-apple-interview-and-perform-well\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">How did you prepare for the Apple interview and perform well?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: I think during the conversation I had with him in person he talked to me about what they wanted in the role and I picked up on those things.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: What kind of things?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: He said there&rsquo;s the perks and the technical side, there&rsquo;s the more dealing with people, dealing with data, all that stuff, I think which you&rsquo;ll be fine on. That&rsquo;s more how do you present yourself how do you think outside your comfort zone. And he talked to me about failure analysis. He mentioned Python.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Those key things that he was mentioning about the role, and I was like I don&rsquo;t know what this is. I need to understand what failure analysis is, the different types. I need to figure out how do I problem solve data and how do I deal with people based off this problem. So I just went, I got home and wrote a list, refreshed my python.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: so you did coding prep for a product manager interview?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: yeah, but funny though they didn&rsquo;t ask me. I know that interns had to use python, so maybe since he was way better that it than I was so he didn&rsquo;t bother. There&rsquo;s some jobs where you&rsquo;re in a non technical job and you still do have to code. So I just went through python, did a couple of hours of failure analysis. I just started going down the list to make sure I did everything on my part, I didn&rsquo;t go to class that day. I did all that I was like okay I feel like I learned everything I had to do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I go to the interview, try to be as friendly as possible, try to be as warm as possible. One good interview tip I always remember is try to make it a conversation don&rsquo;t make it like a question-answer thing, it shouldn&rsquo;t be. My tactic is I need the person to imagine working with me and know that this is casual, this is a transaction. I got to learn very well, because I interviewed a lot. My last two terms I interviewed at a lot of companies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So I found the ones where I was more friendly with them, those are the offers I typically got versus they ask me and I answer and I&rsquo;m not asking about you, turning it back around, just engaging the person in general. I think I did that very well with Michael. When I started he ended up being such a cool guy, so I think that really helped.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"what&rsquo;s-it-actually-like-inside-apple-what&rsquo;s-the-culture-like-the-work-ethic-the-people\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">What&rsquo;s it actually like inside Apple? What&rsquo;s the culture like, the work ethic, the people?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: I think exactly how their program is seen, exactly how their marketing is and their brand, is the same thing that you see behind the scenes. I think this is the best description I can give. You see the amount of work that goes into their processes, and they&rsquo;re very, very particular about perfection. Even their offices. Just their offices- there&rsquo;s this cafe, you go in and you think you&rsquo;re in the best Apple Store, but it&rsquo;s a cafeteria. So that experience, it&rsquo;s not just we talk about our products this way and we do whatever. It transcends through everything.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">If you go to the Apple Store, if you go to IT, if you go anywhere else. I used to work in the lab sometimes. You can go to the lab, where you have test fixtures and all that. It&rsquo;s still pristine. Everything looks great, everything&rsquo;s in order. They have tried to make sure everyone understands that. There&rsquo;s a level of quality that they have and you cannot be below that quality. So I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why apple is where it is today. They have just built an incredible work ethic. We&rsquo;d be on campus till like 10, and the directors are also there. And the managers. Not just all the interns. Everyone is putting in work making sure. They understand the vision, they understand what they need to do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I think they also hired the amount of people that they need to get the job done. I can compare it with Microsoft that has almost twice or 1.5x as many employees but they have different teams doing the same stuff. At apple that does not exist. You&rsquo;re hired for what you have to do. And if you leave the company someone has to fill in for you or someone else is taking on your workload, and that person is stressed or they hire someone else so everybody is needed for what they have to do. Even my intern job, I needed to do that even for things I didn&rsquo;t need to do for. In terms of the process and everything, they have it 100%.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"if-apple-was-so-great-why-didn&rsquo;t-you-go-back\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">If Apple was so great, why didn&rsquo;t you go back?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: There are different answers to that question. Number one, visa. I&rsquo;m a Nigerian student and I have to get an entry. Another thing, you need to apply before you go first, and in order to apply you need to have a piece of paper that says you fulfilled your degree requirements and that doesn&rsquo;t happen until the end of April or June. So there was no way I could even work anywhere in the United States that year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Second one, I wanted to focus more on software. So I did get a return offer from my manager and my supervisor like we want you to come back but I definitely wanted to move into a more software team and I didn&rsquo;t really spend a lot of time looking, when I realized I couldn&rsquo;t go to the States I just dropped it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: You said there&rsquo;s a lot of workload right?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: Yeah there was a lot of work. I was okay doing that work at that time, because I was it&rsquo;s time to grind but I was rethinking it. I was thinking do I really want to work that hard? I&rsquo;d probably do it again if I&rsquo;m honest, I&rsquo;m at the stage where I&rsquo;m like you want to focus on your career, you want to earn a lot, so I wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing it again to be honest if I had the right team.

I remember when I took my e co-op term that&rsquo;s when most of my friends started working at companies like Facebook, google, Microsoft. When I was working on Pave I was questioning myself like why am I doing this I could be working. You shouldn&rsquo;t compare yourself, first of all. I remember that time feeling like I really want.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Even when I left my startup I was like I need to find a job. It made sense for me to. Now is the time I have 2 co-ops left let me do this I want to work at the best of the best, I want to push myself. I think just changes you have to make, like I mentioned in the article I focused mostly on getting a good job and I was like hey I want a product manager job, I would prefer ones that are in California but anywhere else, so I applied to all of the places.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So I never did only California like oh I&rsquo;m not going anywhere else. I got offers for Toronto companies, Waterloo companies, Seattle, New York, California, and just ended up going to Seattle, that was the best offer I got at that time. But it&rsquo;s a balance of things, I think school is at the back burner and I used to take a lot of interest in pictures so that was also on the back burner so I also couldn&rsquo;t balance that anymore. So I was like you know what interview prepping, studying, studying for interviews, that&rsquo;s how. And then when I got there, you see the expectations you have to perform, you have to continue to to be at the top of your game because everyone around you is smart, everyone around you is at the top of their game. You definitely get some of that and use that as fuel to make yourself better.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"what-kinds-of-things-were-you-doing-for-interview-prep\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">What kinds of things were you doing for interview prep?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: I was reading a lot of &ldquo;cracking the PM interview,&rdquo; I did maybe some other than just research, looking up, refreshing my memory, read a lot of case studies, I just google stuff online, talked to a lot of people&hellip;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-network\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">How do you network?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: Honestly I used to be a very social person, not as much anymore. I have no shame, I reach out to people. I&rsquo;d tell my friends hey do you know anyone that&rsquo;s done this? Talk to them about it, see how the interview was, what do they typically ask? So just talking to a lot of people who had this experience. How do I stand out? People just give me tips as a request like hey I just need to get 3 things. So that was just me going around, I was determined. I was like hey I need to get a good job. Honestly I think when you&rsquo;re focused on something if your goal is very clear it&rsquo;s so much easier for you to execute it. That term was when I had the highest number of interviews, higher number of offers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"tomiwa-wasn&rsquo;t-it-risky-when-you-said-you-neglected-school-to-focus-on-interview-prep-especially-as-an-international-student\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">Tomiwa: Wasn&rsquo;t it risky when you said you neglected school to focus on interview prep? Especially as an international student?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: I think you learn how to finesse these things. You know the things you need to do. When you get to that stage when you&rsquo;re not scared of failing out anymore you understand how things work and how to get things done. You have to go to labs, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to go to class. I didn&rsquo;t go to class. I&rsquo;m not saying you shouldn&rsquo;t go to class. I had a very good lab partner where we delegated. We had lab partners for all our classes. We had 3 or 4 labs, so he&rsquo;d take 2 and I&rsquo;d take 2. That way I have to focus on just one thing versus all these other things, and he would focus on that. You carry all those labs and I&rsquo;ll carry all those labs. So it&rsquo;s just finding ways around, honestly if you have a good circle where everyone&rsquo;s focused on the same thing like assignments and stuff we always help each other out, assignments was always a group thing. If you have 5 questions each one takes one and we split it. I don&rsquo;t know if this is plagiarizing or anything, I want you to know whatever school is listening, but we found a way to make it work, we talk to each other.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I remember times when we&rsquo;d all be in one house during finals season and someone would learn this chapter and teach everyone else because we all missed out on it. Once I understand how to do something very well we teach it. So you know how to do just enough so you can get by. At that point we weren&rsquo;t trying to get high grades or anything because we already knew experience is where it&rsquo;s at. As long as you can pass Waterloo with an average of above 70 we&rsquo;re good. It was over 60 but for most of us it was over 70 was decent. Above 70 was good, focus on getting good jobs because when you graduate you want to get a good job. That helped a lot. Having a good circle of friends who passed ideas off each other. I think that went a long way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"how-did-you-get-your-job-at-ecobee\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">How did you get your job at Ecobee?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: Once I graduated I knew I had to come back to Canada.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: Why?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: Because of that whole visa situation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: Did you think about going back to Nigeria?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: No, not at the moment I started my job search very late because I was still trying to push for going to the states till the end of the term but that didn&rsquo;t work out so now I was like I have to job search and I was planning my grad trip in may-ish, June, So I started job hunting in July I was like wow I need to step in.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">First thing I learned is to know the PM roles in Canada. In the states you have PM programs where fresh grads can be PMs and you learn and work for them for 2 years and then become product manager. So they had a lot of those that were product focused companies versus Canada where a company would have a couple of PMs, like one PM to 20 developers where in the states it&rsquo;s like one PM to 4 or 5 developers. Most of them were asking for 5 years of experience, very few that you see are asking for 2. It was very challenging finding something. I think I was just set on, like I mentioned, when you have that goal.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: So what were you doing, were you reaching out, finding jobs online?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: I tried to get an in person or speak to a recruiter. Applying online never affected me. I did that sometimes but most times I&rsquo;d try reach out, like hey can I speak to a recruiter, I&rsquo;m very interested in this role, this is my experiences I&rsquo;ve done internships here, I&rsquo;ve built this product from scratch. I didn&rsquo;t get a lot of people that didn&rsquo;t talk to me, but there&rsquo;s some companies that said you sound very great but your internship is okay. I got a lot of calls and it&rsquo;s very heartbreaking when I was like hey give me a chance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Still, I was focused. A lot of people were like how are you as a developer since you have developer experience, we can hire you for two years and you can switch out. Nope, I want to be a PM. I was not taking it. Whenever a company would say try this try that. It was very challenging. Then I went to Ecobee and I learned to them when I was still at Microsoft because I worked on something while I was there. I was like wow they&rsquo;re in Canada, first of all I was excited they were in Canada. This one I actually applied online because I didn&rsquo;t know anyone working there but I reached out to a recruiter. I messaged her. Maybe that helped, but immediately I connected with her and expressed my interest. I got a call for an interview.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">As I started learning about the product and the process, I really enjoyed the interview process, it was the first initial screening. It was good, I really enjoyed the conversation it was great. The last round was the case study. You had to go for one week, they give you a problem to solve and you come back to solve it. I really enjoyed working there. You get to learn about the product, learn about the opportunities, I was like woah this is great.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So I interviewed, did the case study, it was so great. It was a nice way to get my juices flowing. So you have a decent understanding of the company functions and its products. So when you&rsquo;re at a company you&rsquo;re not totally blind, I mean you have some assumptions but they&rsquo;re easily corrected once you start. I did reply to a couple of offers eventually very late but I think Ecobee by far&hellip; they were offering me more autonomy, like the products I was going to be working on, seemed like I&rsquo;d have a lot of autonomy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">What other offers did you get?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: There was this other startup called KoHo, I wrote an article about them. I was talking to them, it wasn&rsquo;t really a PM role but it was something similar. The other one was Shopify but I wasn&rsquo;t getting any luck with a good team.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h2 id=\"what-are-some-of-the-big-problems-you-want-to-solve\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">What are some of the big problems you want to solve?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Sefunmi: So right now the way I think about it as a basic human right, and I think this is different to everyone but for me I&rsquo;m going to take a step back: food and water, number one. If people can&rsquo;t eat and drink, they won&rsquo;t be productive. Food and water is bare minimum. People look at homeless people or people in societies that are not doing well, it&rsquo;s easy to say these people aren&rsquo;t working. If you don&rsquo;t have the strength to work, if your body doesn&rsquo;t have the nutrients your brain is not going to be like oh let me do this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Same with housing, it&rsquo;s another one. For societies that have a lot of homeless problems or if homes are very expensive. Removing the things that people don&rsquo;t need to worry about so they can be more productive. Electricity is a huge one. Electricity unblocks so many things. Especially in a country like Nigeria where so many more opportunities open up when you have electricity. So I think it&rsquo;s removing the things you need to survive. If you have food, water, and shelter, you can do a bunch of other things.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Education not just in terms of structure and going to school but access to information that can give you an advantage. The reason why I&rsquo;m here today is because I have an advantage because of the education, because I went to Waterloo. Waterloo had this co-op program. It&rsquo;s giving people access to information and education in however way, I don&rsquo;t know what that will be but I think it means a huge reform so we need to rethink it based on society, based on the country.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So those are the main things. If you give all of that then you can say you have no excuse. If you give me all the things I need to succeed, if you do not do anything then that&rsquo;s on you. Because you&rsquo;ve been given everything, food, water, you have shelter, access to electricity, and information, and you&rsquo;re safe, and you&rsquo;re not dealing with war, your life isn&rsquo;t threatened&hellip; stuff like that. So those five things.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: Thanks for joining us on this episode of Atila TV Sefunmi!

On the first point, for example, someone I messaged on Twitter said that the reason she didn&rsquo;t apply to scholarships is she worried that her grades were not good enough and she didn&rsquo;t have enough extracurriculars. This is a valid concern but we can easily debunk this.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I showed in the video at 22:22 that of the 3 scholarships I found when I found female scholarships for her, none of them had strict grade requirements. One of them required a B- average, which is about a 60% average, and the other one required admissions into an honors program but no explicit grade requirement. I also suggest searching for &ldquo;essay&rdquo; or &ldquo;essay contest&rdquo; scholarships as those typically don&rsquo;t have strict requirements. Though, they do require your time, which is another common concern people bring up.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Scholarships take a lot of time. But I would propose that spending time applying to scholarships is a better use of your time and has a higher return on investment than working a part time Job! Let&rsquo;s do some math real quick.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Suppose that you spend 20 hours on each scholarship you apply to. Each scholarship pays about $2,000 and you have a success rate of getting accepted for about 20% of the scholarships you apply for. This means that you will need to apply to about 5 scholarships to win one scholarship, but on a per hour basis, you actually made $20/hr, way better than most part time jobs.[Watch the video at 23:33 to see me walk through the math in more detail]</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"></p>\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,sans,sans-serif; width: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; border: none;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"126\" /><col width=\"100\" /></colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Time (hrs)&quot;}\">Time (hrs)</td>\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: right;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:20}\">20</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Payout&quot;}\">Payout</td>\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: right;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:2000}\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"[null,4,&quot;\\&quot;$\\&quot;#,##0&quot;,1]\">$2,000</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Sucess Rate&quot;}\">Sucess Rate</td>\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: right;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:0.2}\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"[null,3,&quot;0%&quot;,1]\">20%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Scholarships/Payout&quot;}\">Scholarships/Payout</td>\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: right;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:5}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=1/R[-1]C[0]\">5</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;$/hr&quot;}\">$/hr</td>\r\n<td style=\"overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: right;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:3,&quot;3&quot;:20}\" data-sheets-numberformat=\"[null,4,&quot;\\&quot;$\\&quot;#,##0&quot;,1]\" data-sheets-formula=\"=R[-4]C[0]/(R[-5]C[0]*R[-2]C[0])\">$20</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">On a purely financial basis, you can definitely make a strong argument that you are better off spending 100 hours applying to 5 scholarships as opposed to spending 100 hours at a part time job. There are also the intangibles, one of the first jobs I ever had was as a janitor in the city of London making about $14/hr. While the job was decent and my manager was good, the main thing I got out of that job was just money. I didn&rsquo;t really gain a lot of transferable skills I could put on my resume, LinkedIn or talk about in interviews. Whereas when you win a scholarship there are a lot of intangible benefits. You could be invited to a dinner and networking with the donor, get your name on a website or newspaper, &ldquo;humble brag&rdquo; about it on your LinkedIn, talk about it in an interview or even leverage it to get more scholarships.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\r\n<h2 id=\"create-event-for-scholarship-deadline\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">2.

[32:15] -&gt; [32:33]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Tomiwa Ademidun:</strong> You said you had 5 offers Oliver Wyman, Deloitte, Flex Port&nbsp;, CK and Microsoft. Out of those 5 you picked Credit Karma, what was your Rationale? [32:35]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Umesh Khanna:</strong> So I&rsquo;ll talk about the consulting side first. So with Deloitte it was the BTA program. Oliver Wyman, management consulting internship in New York. Between the two, I didn&rsquo;t really want to do BTA in the Toronto office so that was a quick elimination. So OW as the winner for consulting side. So for the tech side-</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: This is like the playoffs&hellip;</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Yeah, it&rsquo;s essentially the playoffs. And you have essentially 2 weeks to decide between all these companies. Flexport I had already been there I know exactly how it works and it was a great experience.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: You said you had a full time offer if you decided to come back.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Well a potential full time offer. I knew the team, relationships were there. So if I were to go somewhere else and learn some more things and come back it&rsquo;s possible that could be transitioned. My goal is to keep on learning, be a better person, be able to learn as much as I can. So Flexport is eliminated. So now It&rsquo;s between Microsoft and Credit Karma. One of the things I mentioned was a focus on the team. SO the team for Microsoft was database security or reliability something. It wasn&rsquo;t very&hellip;</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: It was very technical</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: very technical, It just wasn&rsquo;t something I was into. Meanwhile Credit Karma was their newest team. Small team, great manager.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So now for me it was between Oliver Wyman and Credit Karma.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: The championships.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Yeah, now it&rsquo;s the championships. Oliver Wyman or Credit Karma. So I have a weekend now to figure out these two. That was probably one of the hardest decisions I&rsquo;ve had to make in a really long time. With OW it&rsquo;s a great experience, completely brand new. Haven&rsquo;t tried it. Credit Karma, same situation but I&rsquo;ve already kind of done product so it might be a bit repetitive. It might not be as much of a learning experience.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So I think it&rsquo;s best to ask someone who&rsquo;ve already gone through something like this. So I checked LinkedIn. Saw people who did consulting to product or product to consulting. Just reached out to them, some of them were already in my networks so quick Facebook message, if they weren&rsquo;t quick coffee chat and see what their experience was.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So it was 10&ndash;15 product chats with those people. The biggest realization there. To save you all that time and trouble is. First of all, both paths were amazing. First thing everyone said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine don&rsquo;t worry. But just know that a lot of these consultants are trying to go to product. Not many product people are trying to go into consulting.&rdquo; So the ones who did want to go into consulting, all they had to do was go get an MBA. Same thing was said for consulting to product. But it seemed like it was a lot more difficult for them to transition to product even though they went to an MBA program.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It just made sense for the mentality of I can do product right now and if I did want to switch consulting I can go get an MBA or reattempt for consulting afterwards.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I remember it was two days before the deadlines. Someone in consulting messaged me, a cold message. She asked &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m at this firm, noticed you&rsquo;re in product at this company would love to chat&rdquo;. I was like &ldquo;Wait you&rsquo;re trying to get to my spot and I&rsquo;m trying to get to your spot what the heck.&rdquo; Then it hit me just keep on learning, keep on doing product it&rsquo;s the most impactful thing right now. I&rsquo;ll miss out on the entire consulting aspect of everything but..</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Make the best of it.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Yeah make the best of it. If product management turns to chaos in the next internship, which hopefully it doesn&rsquo;t, I can just transition back.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">How Umesh got into one of the Most Competitive Programs in Canada, Waterloo Engineering</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: You ended up choosing Waterloo Engineering. I mentioned at the beginning, Waterloo Engineering, a very prestigious program, very difficult to get into. Now, whenever I ask this question people always want to be modest and &ldquo;Oh you know blah blah blah&rdquo;. But if you had to look back on yourself what do you think it is that helped you get into such a competitive program. [5:05]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Sure, I think the first thing was marks. Waterloo is a very competitive program as you said. The benchmark or requirement to get in always increase. It&rsquo;s insane how some students need a 98 average to even-</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What average did you have in high school when you applied?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: In high school I had a 96 cumulative. That was at that point good enough. I feel like If I applied now it might not be, it&rsquo;s become so competitive. It&rsquo;s gotten harder in that period in time.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">When I applied it as for electrical engineering. It was what my dad was doing, a lot of friends and family were doing. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what engineering to go into but ECE seemed like the most reasonable choice at that point. So when I was applying I remember writing the AIF and mentioned playing with things, trying to break things, figure out trying to figure out how to build things from scratch. That may not have helped my case to get into Waterloo, but that was one of the things I was really passionate about.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: So one of the things always wonder about is that for example, I know with Ivey, they say it&rsquo;s not just enough to have high grades you need to have extracurriculars and be well rounded. For Waterloo engineering is it just all grades or you need to do other stuff as well. [6:30]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: With the AIF I remember reading Bill Anderson&rsquo;s famous blog for Waterloo Engineering. He talks about how you need to have the grades but the AIF could bump your score. So as far as I know, again not part of the recruiting for Waterloo but you apply with your grade but the AIF can bump you one or two marks and than that cumulative value is what is compared against others.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So in the AIF you talk about your extracurriculars, your passions. So for extracurriculars I was super involved in council and DECA and was super involved in both. SO I think that helped as well for AIF form.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What about for&nbsp;&hellip; I think I already know the answer to this question but I&rsquo;m gonna ask it anyway. Do you need prior engineering experience, does that help your application?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: I don&rsquo;t think so. I didn&rsquo;t have much really engineering experience. For me it was just messing around and tinkering with things. I have a lot of friends who have never coded before. Even for me, very little coding.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Final Question, on that piece. What other schools did you apply to?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: I was not confident at all, I was super scared of even getting in anywhere. So I actually wasted a lot of application fees. I think I applied to 9 programs and in like 5 schools.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What were the schools?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Waterloo, McMaster, Western, Queen;&rsquo;s, Schulich.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Combination of business and engineering right? Nine applications and you ended up getting your top choice which was pretty cool. Did you accept right away?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Not really, even when I got that. I also had the BMOs, Ivey offer and it was a hard decision. It took some time to kind of reflect understand what I wanted felt like Waterloo was the right choice at at that point and I&rsquo;m happy I took it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Why He Switched From Electrical to Systems Engineering</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Off air you said that.. I actually thought you had always been a systems engineer. So you mentioned off Air that you actually started off in Electrical and made the switch to systems, why is that? [9:10]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Yeah, so electrical is really cool as I mentioned. Going in, my goal is to figure out how to build things. My first year of electrical I realized this isn&rsquo;t exactly the case. Electrical is great for if you want to improve things or know the specs of very electrical or software heavy things. That wasn&rsquo;t very interesting to me. I didn&rsquo;t know about the program called systems engineering. Which I feel like there&rsquo;s not a lot of resources online, especially as a high schooler talking about systems. There weren&rsquo;t really many people that I knew who were in systems engineering. Actually I didn&rsquo;t know anyone when I was in high school. The idea of systems was taking all the engineering systems and putting it into one. The idea was that you have an understanding of every single aspect of things. Probably not the expertise aspect but the workable aspects. So you&rsquo;ll know how to design a chip or you&rsquo;ll know how to build some software, or what kind of plastics work better for something. With that knowledge you can build whatever you want. That&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted out of an education so that&rsquo;s why I made that switch</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Was it a bit nerve wracking at all to make the switch.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Oh yeah [Laughs]. Making the switch you had to apply. I had to apply in my 1B (second semester) term of school. Because there wouldn&rsquo;t just let me transfer. So I had to apply and I was being considered amongst the other high school students that were applying. So now I&rsquo;m essentially being compared to all these high school students. They&rsquo;re looking at my high school and engineering marks. Somehow managed to get into a competitive class. So I did lose a year because of the switch because it was definitely worth.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">The Most Difficult Internship to Get and How To Get&nbsp;It</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Out of all the five internships you&rsquo;ve had so far. You mentioned that you&rsquo;re working at Credit Karma next. Now we&rsquo;re up to six internships, you haven&rsquo;t even finished university yet. Out of all six of internships, which one was the most difficult one to get? [19:25]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: I think it was the most recent one, Flexport&nbsp;. This is actually a funny story. This is one of those things I didn&rsquo;t realize was a thing. I&rsquo;ve always heard about it but I never realized it was a thing. Keep on trying even though you get rejected. What I mean by that is that I actually applied to Flexport through the recruiter, sent her an email. &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m interested in Product. I know you&rsquo;re building this.&rdquo; Within 15 minutes got a reply, sorry we&rsquo;re not looking to hire for this position. But if you&rsquo;re an engineering or software engineer we&rsquo;ll interview you.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I was like &ldquo;Im trying for product&rdquo;, they were like Nope, complete deny. Essentially a rejection. That really hurt because it was a great product, great team, exactly what I want to do, I can see myself working there. After the rejection I&rsquo;m like screw this. SO I sent the ceo of the company an email.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: How did you get his email?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: You can make email permutations. A lot of websites that can do that for you. I Said &ldquo;Hey this is my background. I have a tech background and product background. I know you have this team, all I said was I need 15 minutes with you, I want to be a part of this tema and be able to build this team.&rdquo; The next day he replies, he CCd me to my recent boss. &ldquo;Hey this is an intern, might be interested in your team, go talk.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">After a few interviews with them, a bunch of interviews. The interviews were very hard because they were very different people. The first one was with my direct manager, the second one was with my now mentor. They were all talking about different things, what is my experience, what I can offer, what I can learn, what I want to learn.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">That was the hardest internship to get because of the concern that this is sort of my dream job and the fear that the find out that I already got rejected they might not even be open to talking. It was kind of a tricky one to get but I was glad that I went through that and still kept on hammering even after the rejection</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Dude, I love that story. That&rsquo;s such a boss move. The recruiter said No, So you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;Forget this&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m going to email the CEO.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: I always tell people. This is sort of my advice to you guys. Everything works but I personally don&rsquo;t recommend reaching out to recruiters. First of all recruiters they get so much deal flow. Second, they are just following an algorithm. You don&rsquo;t match this box or criteria I was told to look for, put you aside.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Which is fair, they are doing their job. You can&rsquo;t blame them for that.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: That&rsquo;s true.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: I wasn&rsquo;t a waterloo software engineering so click next. But that was probably one of the most impactful learning experience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">How to Get a job in Tech and Reaching out Recruiters</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Speaking of that. For someone who wants to get a job in tech. What advice would you give someone. [22:55]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Yeah, I&rsquo;ll look into the camera for this one. Honestly, I think its two parts. One is figure out what you want to do. If you don&rsquo;t know what you want to do. Just take a day and choose something. Then learn it, learn it quickly, you don&rsquo;t have to be the best at it but be able to be somewhat proficient. Then just go and apply for all those jobs that you can work at.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I think the first job should not matter where you go long term. The first job is more about figuring out. How I used my internships is to figure out what you don&rsquo;t like but also what you do like. Through my internships I realized that I don&rsquo;t like coding. I realized that early on which is great so now I can make sure I focus on other things.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: How about something more tactical. So a couple things that come to mind. People always ask me this. I want to email the recruiter or I even want to email the CEO. What should I put in that email. How do I humble brag? [24:10]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: First, don&rsquo;t make generic emails. That&rsquo;s the biggest no-no that anyone can say. I&rsquo;ve been hit with generic emails by recruiters or even students.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: You can tell.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: You can tell. You don&rsquo;t even reply to those. If someone sent me an email and it was genuine and if I could help them I would, if I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll reply and say, I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t do this but best of luck. But if it&rsquo;s a generic email you just delete.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What should you write in those emails?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Honestly, just be honest for what you want. Everyone has a goal or desire. I would like to know that or, people will like to know that. So if your goal is to get a job somewhere. Just talk about why you want to work there, what you;ve heard of them, what excites you about them.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you can convince them of that you can definitely get an interview. That&rsquo;s where the hard, tricky part starts.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: When you emailed the CEO what did you say, to him?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: With Ryan, the email said 2 things. First of all&nbsp;, I apologized for the cold email and thanked him for reading this.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Quick blurb, &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m a student.&rdquo; Oh yeah, by the way always use the student card. The student card helps so much. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a student from this school, I heard of Flexport Capital. Second sentence I have a background in lending, background in Product, worked at Shopify so I know about trade. Would love to work at Flexport for these reasons.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The last sentence is kind of a call to action. When you send an email make sure you tell them what to do next. If you tell them you&rsquo;re a student. So what?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What was your call to action?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Essentially, can I have 15 minutes of your time to have q ucik call to talk more about this or be pointed towards the appropriate manager so I can learn more. That&rsquo;s what happened.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: There&rsquo;s always two ways to go about this. How direct should you be? For example, for me when I cold email people I&rsquo;m very straight to the point. Basically I want an interview, I also would like for you to refer me. Then blah blah blah. So were you more like can I just talk. Or were you I want to talk so I can get an interview.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: So I did some research beforehand. Everyone has some sort of style. Some people love confrontation, straight to the point. Some people don&rsquo;t like that. Some of my good friends who are in product, if you send them a straight email, &ldquo;Hey I need this.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll be like no, that&rsquo;s not a very polite way to ask. Whereas for me I like direct, just get to the point.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So I researched and talked to someone from Flexport who was a recent graduate from Waterloo. Reached out to him and asked What&rsquo;s going on what should I know about Flexport. This is before reaching out to recruiters trying to figure out what the mindset of Flexport is. Are they direct or not? Based on his feedback he gave me the rundown, the recruiter is very nice so be very clear and transparent. He&rsquo;s like the CEO is very direct, very fast. So if I wanted to talk to the recruiter, my email was very soft and very nice.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Then once I got the rejection, just went to the CEO and said &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up&rdquo;. That might not work for a lot of people, honestly. It was a gutsy move, he could have just thrown that out in a second if it was a big problem.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Editor&rsquo;s Note: I wrote an article about <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"edit/tomiwa/how-i-got-interviews-at-google-facebook-and-bridgewater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/edit/tomiwa/how-i-got-interviews-at-google-facebook-and-bridgewater\">how to get an interview at top tech companies</a> and included some <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"edit/tomiwa/how-i-got-interviews-at-google-facebook-and-bridgewater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/edit/tomiwa/how-i-got-interviews-at-google-facebook-and-bridgewater\">sample emails</a> you can use when emailing people.]</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">What Umesh is Currently Obsessed&nbsp;with?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">What are you currently obsessed with? This can literally be anything. A workout at the gym a new restaurant, Youtube channel, Instagram account, podcast book anything? [51:25]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Right now, it&rsquo;s just giving back.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: *facepalm* Oh my goodness you can&rsquo;t say that. You can not say that.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: I think I can definitely say that. That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m obsessed with. Right now I think I&rsquo;ve booked my entire schedule in terms of: 20% is academic, no coop so there&rsquo;s not recruiting right now. The rest of it is enjoying time with friends, which I feel like I&rsquo;ve left a lot.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Okay so let&rsquo;s talk about that. When you&rsquo;re not trying to make the world a better place and give back, all that great stuff. When you want to kick back and relax, what&rsquo;s your go to activity.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Let me think about this. I feel like after this event that we&rsquo;re at right now. Probably just going home reading a quick book and just sleeping. I haven&rsquo;t slept in a long time.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What are some good books you&rsquo;re reading right now or podcasts?

Oh, nevermind it&rsquo;s How I built this. I think it&rsquo;s really cool. It&rsquo;s insane how everyone has a cool story, not many people know these stories.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">But I think that&rsquo;s the soft answer. The more fun answer, is honestly, just go out, go to a club, go to a bar. You&rsquo;ll find me at easy or rebel. That&rsquo;s the more realistic answer of me relaxing. Clubbing just energizes me and lets me get back to work. [53:20]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I think that&rsquo;s another point for burning out. With burning out I realized that one thing that energizes me or makes me the extrovert that I am is clubbing. I remember in one of the summers going clubbing every 2 or 3 weeks just brought me back to life and grind.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Final Piece of Advice &mdash; How To Stop Comparing Yourself to&nbsp;Others</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What&rsquo;s something you would tell your younger self or someone watching this. [54:15]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: I think it would be two parts. Going back to the idea which kind of learned later. Don&rsquo;t compare yourself. Just focus on yourself, do what you like keep on building yourself. I think that&rsquo;s super relevant, super important.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Just to push you a bit more on that question. You&rsquo;re so right about this. But my issue with that Umesh, is that everyone know this. And you&rsquo;re gonna tell them this&hellip;</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: Grade 11 me did not know this. Grade 11 me was super&hellip; I guess it wasn&rsquo;t a competitive environment because there weren&rsquo;t that many students. But it was still the mentality of I need to be number one. Or I need to get this so I can get this. I think having that mentality was really toxic. I think looking back, dude don&rsquo;t be like that.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: SO let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re mentoring someone. And you&rsquo;re telling them don&rsquo;t compare yourself to other people. And they know they shouldn&rsquo;t do it but they&rsquo;re still doing it anyway, Is there anything you can say or advice you can give so they can stop doing that</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">UK: It&rsquo;s probably hard to convince but my biggest feedback is just asking them two things. First thing is what do you like doing. That&rsquo;s what you asked me as well. It&rsquo;s hard for me to answer, I&rsquo;m still figuring that out. But what do you like doing and keep doing that. Then talk about what do you not like doing. If they can answer that, it&rsquo;s great. If hey can&rsquo;t answer that, which I feel was the case with me&nbsp;. If you asked me I would say, I don&rsquo;t know. I want to do everything. Getting to the point of I want to do everything, that gets into the competitive mindset.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: I&rsquo;m going to jump on that piece of advice as well. One thing I always like to tell people is this idea of social media. I&rsquo;m not going to tell people not to use social media because I think social media actually makes the world a better place. But I think it&rsquo;s all about how you use it.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">What I always tell people is that if you following someone and they&rsquo;re really successful you feel two emotions. You either feel inspired or you feel envious. I&rsquo;m always like if you follow someone and they just constantly making you feel envious, jealous and hate yourself, unfollow them. But if you&rsquo;re following someone and they inspire you, then follow more people that are like that. So make sure you&rsquo;re getting more inputs that are inspirational and not envious.

graf--h3\">Consulting and Banking for Prestige versus Passion and Interview Prep</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Tomiwa Ademidun: Now I have to ask you this. You&rsquo;ve doing banking and consulting, the two most stereotypical, cliche business school careers. So my question now is how much of you going into banking and consulting is just doing what everyone else is doing, all the other smart people are doing it, sort of doing it for &ldquo;clout&rdquo; versus it being your genuine passion and something you enjoy?&rdquo; &mdash; [32:25]</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Paul Okundaye: 100% and that&rsquo;s a teeter totter you have to be real with yourself. With banking again, I realize now that hindsight is 20/20 a lot of me going into banking was #1, I love math and I love whole= problem solving, analytical stuff. I actually enjoy that part of banking, building the models.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">But I realized that on the whole I was mostly going into banking because it was the most prestigious job and this is the thing people starting to discuss now is Prestige chasing just for the sake of it. &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m going to do banking because it&rsquo;s the quote top job&rsquo; for someone coming out of business school. You can make the same argument for consulting as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I genuinely think I&rsquo;m a lot happier with my choice for me specifically. Again, this is something that is person dependent. I have a lot of friends who are going into banking who absolutely love it. One of my coworkers at RBC this summer we used to call him the banking robot, he&rsquo;s in the program at McGill that only accepts like 20 people, Portfolio management program. So this guy loves it, he asks to stay at late as possible. So if that&rsquo;s you, screw what I&rsquo;m saying, screw what everyone else is saying, do it. You need to be real with yourself and I realized that wasn&rsquo;t me. There is diminishing marginal returns on the nth dollar when you get to a certain point.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I actually did the math obviously before I switched into consulting. I looked at my pay cheque from RBC and the hours I was working and I looked at my paycheque from Bain and the hours I would be working at Bain and it was proportional. At RBC I&rsquo;d probably be working around 90 hours, at Bain around 60&ndash;70 and the pay ended up being proportional.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: But that&rsquo;s entry level salary. With banking, long term you make more money.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">But my point though is that the grind part is at the entry level. Once you&rsquo;ve Done your two years in banking it gets easier. But you&rsquo;re selling yourself for two years. Don&rsquo;t fool yourself it&rsquo;s a tax, You have to accept that. Do I like it enough that I&rsquo;m willing to pay that tax. That is something where I was real to myself off where I said I would rather have my weekends off and take less money and leave the office every day at 7 or 8. Instead of leaving the office at 11, 12 1am</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: But on the consulting part. We both have a lot of friends that want to go into consulting, MBB not so much they enjoy doing it but all their friends are doing it. All the smart people are doing it. So for you how much of you going into consulting is because it has a lot of clout, it&rsquo;s going to look good on my LinkedIn, versus consulting is what I enjoy doing? [35:15]</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: Don&rsquo;t fool yourself there is always a base level of I need to progress, I want to go to business school or I want to be successful and knowing a brand name MBB on your resume helps. But at the same time, the key part and the distinction for me why I knew that consulting was right was the interview prep process. SO preparing for banking versus preparing for consulting, I actually enjoyed preparing for consulting and that was the key part for me.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For banking I needed to learn how did I build a DCF and all that stuff. Banking it&rsquo;s just like recall. Its deterministic, its 1+1 =2, there&rsquo;s always a right answer. But consulting by definition you need to be a jack of all trades.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">How I prepared myself was that I lived downtown when I was working there for the summer. So when i walked home from work, i would see a business and try to analyze it from the outside. Based on how many people are in there right now, it&rsquo;s 7 o&rsquo;clock, I look at this neighbourhood, this is the traffic flow, is this a good business. Now I can&rsquo;t turn by brain off&nbsp;, but I found I really liked that process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Or even doing case interviews, I would do a practice interview with someone, they would give me a business case, I would use my problem solving to figure out is this the right option for them. I would make mistakes and learn from them. That process was how I knew I actually liked consulting. Because if I was just doing it for the clout chase and I didn&rsquo;t like it, I would have done it anyway. I would have been like this sucks, this prep sucks but I have to do it for the prestige. That&rsquo;s how banking was. That&rsquo;s how I realized that I didn&rsquo;t like the prep for banking, I was good at it but i didn&rsquo;t enjoy. That&rsquo;s the distinction for me.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">You Only Got That Job Because You&rsquo;re&nbsp;Black</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Tomiwa Ademidun: You mentioned the diversity scholarship. One thing that&rsquo;s controversial right now is the idea of &ldquo;you only got this because you&rsquo;re black&rdquo; As someone who got a job through the diversity program. How do you feel when people make comments like that. [13:55]</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Paul Okundaye: Well I tell them that I turned down two interviews at Goldman Sachs LA and Moelis and Company LA. I had the interviews, I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to work there. Actually, let me put it this way. For me personally, I don&rsquo;t like the united States, I couldn&rsquo;t see myself living there long. So initially when I was looking at these banking jobs and I networked with Goldman and Moelis, my thought process was. Okay, it&rsquo;s pretty stupid but I&rsquo;m going to get a job in LA so I can do the &ldquo;LA flex&rdquo; for the summer and then come back to Toronto full time. Then I was like if I want to come back to Toronto full time&nbsp;, where&rsquo;s the best bank in Canada to work for? RBC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">My Goldman and Moelis interviews were set for August and I signed for RBC in July. When I ended up getting the job I thought, How stupid would I be if I turned RBC now just go &ldquo;flex in LA&rdquo; for the summer just to try and come back to RBC again next year. So with the whole diversity affirmative action. People say you get this job because you&rsquo;re this or you get the job because you&rsquo;re that. Well, how many other opportunities did I not get because I&rsquo;m black or did I not get because someone saw my name, that looks like a complicated last name you&rsquo;re [resume is]going in the no pile.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s a perfect system but its the reality of the situation. Like I said earlier, life is not fair. We all get dealt the poker hands we get dealt with. Some of us have to use our uncles because we have those uncles. People like me that don&rsquo;t have those uncles, this is ur way.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">What are You Currently Obsessed&nbsp;With?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Now we&rsquo;re coming to the last part of the interview. There&rsquo;s a question I like to ask called what are you currently obsessed with? This can be anything. It can be a new workout at the gym, a new Youtube channel, a new Instagram, a new restaurant, a book, podcast anything. What are you currently obsessed with? [48:15]</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: Definitely a book. The last book I read, no the current one but the one before that. I read a lot, I&rsquo;m a voracious reader. One of the last books I read is called <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2Oi8jpu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://amzn.to/2Oi8jpu\">Factfulness</a> by Hans Rosling. Bill Gates has this website called Gates Notes and I&rsquo;m a follower of that and every year he publishes the best book of the year and that was one of those. The book talks about Factfulness and ten reasons we&rsquo;re wrong about the world is. Ten reasons why the world is better than we think it is. Humans tend to have this negativity, nostalgia bias. Every generation says in my good old days and we always tend to think the world was better than it is now. So unfortunately this guy died recently, but he was a scientist of Sweden who went to the top of his career and presenting to the who is who of why they are all wrong about the word. So he&rsquo;s giving key facts. So let me ask you if the average man right now goes to school for 10 year,s how long average woman goes to school for?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Six.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: Nine. Exactly, so these are the things he talks about. Or what do you think the literacy rate is for children in developing countries. 20%, 40% or 80%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: 40%</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: 80%. Not to pick on you, I was wrong on all them too. So this is the format he presents the book in. He will posit this question to you and show you why your negativity bias is wrong.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Yeah, because all my answers were all negative than the actual answer</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: Yeah, so that is a cognitive bias we have. The book doesn&rsquo;t just talk about facts, it talks about how can you navigate this post truth era we live in. How can you contextualize and use facts and knowledge as your weapon. It was fantastic, I highly recommend it&nbsp;. Factfulness, by Hans Rosen</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA; I&rsquo;ll link it. What book are you currently reading now. W</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: Currently I&rsquo;m reading <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2Oi8EZi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://amzn.to/2Oi8EZi\">The Order of Time</a> by Carlo Rovelli.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: What&rsquo;s the best way to reach you?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: Facebook</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: We&rsquo;ll also link your LinkedIn because that is very public facing.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Closing General&nbsp;Advice</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: The final question, I&rsquo;m still working on this question, so bear with me. I will ask two questions, pick which one you want to answer. Paul at 16, what would you tell your younger self. Or you can answer from the perspective of someone watching this right now, piece of advice you want to give them. [53:15]</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: I think I&rsquo;ll go with the second one because I&rsquo;m mostly happy with how things have turned out. In terms of anyone watching this. I&rsquo;m going to assume you are between grade 12 to second year. That&rsquo;s the vantage point I&rsquo;m giving this advice. Because I feel like I&rsquo;m not in any position to give anyone my age advice, what do I know?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For grade 12 to second year, get involved! Get involved&nbsp;, get involved, get involved. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is, find something you&rsquo;re interested or passionate about and make an impact. It&rsquo;s not enough to be a general member. It&rsquo;s not enough to be a &ldquo;researcher&rdquo; and attend meetings. Find somewhere you can make an impact where you can get that feeling. Like I did when i went home and I laid down and I said, wow I just did something, I just made a difference. That feeling you can&rsquo;t fabricate it right. Don&rsquo;t think about I&rsquo;m doing this to get the resume, the resume and the professional experience come after you get that feeling not before. Don&rsquo;t put the horse before the cart. Do things because you&rsquo;re interested in them because you make an impact and feel good. Then that impact will help you succeed. Don&rsquo;t do things because you want to succeed. Make an impact and then you&rsquo;ll succeed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: You know how you said you wanted to do three things when you graduate. I think you should add a fourth one, motivational speaker. That was fantastic advice. Also, to add on to what Paul said, that advice does not only apply to people in high school or university or younger than Paul. At any age you&rsquo;re in, even if you&rsquo;re working a full time job, get involved in the community, get involved in things you&rsquo;re interested in. It will always be useful to you down the line</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: And be a lifelong learner. Never stop you have to constantly keep iterating because I&rsquo;ll repeat what my friend said to be because it really stuck with me. So at Ivey we have this scholarship called the Entrepreneurship scholarship and I was fortunate enough to get one. Zack, who we both know. Everyone had to give a 3 minute speech and he said this and it really resonated with me. If you are already the person that you want to be today, then what are you striving for. You have to be a lifelong learner, you have to constantly improve, constantly iterate, then make an impact.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: Well said, Paul thanks for joining us men</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PO: Thanks for having me, this was great, I hope it was great for you guys as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">TA: We&rsquo;ll catch you guys on the next episode of Atila TV, peace!</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--empty\">&nbsp;</p>",

People go into that program with 90s from high school, but different schools had different standards and different levels of competition. In first year, about 50% dropped out or switched out to a different program.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">You worked at IBM and Shopify &mdash; how did those opportunities come about? [5:02]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">IBM was a bit of a fluke, I miraculously got an interview in first year, which I completely bombed by the way. I was given a relatively simple problem about some optimization problem applied to real life. I knew I failed because I didn&rsquo;t get anywhere close to a good answer. I spent the rest of the afternoon researching it and wrote a 3&ndash;4 page analysis on it and sent it to the manager who interview me. That&rsquo;s what changed his mind about me because he realized this kid&rsquo;s willing to put in the work and go the extra mile.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Tell us how Shopify came about [5:53]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Shopify was also a bit of a fluke. After second year, I wanted to take some time and do some internship work. I got back to IBM and got a 16 month offer from them and I accepted it. My roommate gave me the idea of splitting the 16 months into four co-oops instead. Shopify at the time was a growing company and had some interesting perks and an amazing team. After a couple rounds of interviews, I did get the offer and decided to do 4 months at IBM and 4 months at Shopify, which I renewed four months after.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">How would you compare working at a big company like IBM to working at a smaller startup like Shopify?</strong> [7:18]</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It was like night and day. I think Shopify was kind of what brought me to the startup world. People were very open to talking to me and helping me and mentoring me &mdash; they were a lot more self-driven. There were a lot of perks and a lot of other things that made me fall in love with the start up culture after that.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why did you pick software? [8:15]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">How did the WealthSimple opportunity come up? [9:01]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">WealthSimple is also a fluke. I feel like this is a recurring theme in my life. During 3rd year, I applied to four or five co-ops that summer &mdash; Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Yelp. I figured that at least one of them would want me but in the end I got rejected by all them. Probably because I was so cocky. I realized in late February that I had to find a job in Toronto ASAP. I came across WealthSimple&rsquo;s page and had many applications at this point, but I was also very interested in finance. I reached out to their manager and asked him if they were willing to open up any co-op positions. They eventually gave me an offer after a few rounds of interviews.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">At the end of the four months it was time to go back to school &mdash; but what did you end up doing instead? [11:47]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I dropped out of UofT to work there full time. By the end of the two weeks, the engineer that was mentoring me was very helpful and taught me so much. Within those 10 working days I realized that I could learn so much here than I could at school &mdash; everyone here was so talented and were so interesting. I asked the manager if he was interested in giving me a full time offer and I would just not go back to school.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What is Beatcamp? [13:25]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I started working with my colleague to build this music marketplace where producers could license their instrumentals to rappers and then rappers would then take that instrumental, rap on top of it and sell the finished song.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Tell us about how your priorities in regards to social media have changed. [19:20]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Getting likes is like a dopamine hit. But I think I realized after a while that a lot of the people who did follow me were people I didn&rsquo;t even know them or they didn&rsquo;t care about me. So, why does it matter if they like my photos? Watching my happiness depend on their feedback and likes made me feel that my life was being taken over by all of that. I did everything for the gram, so I decided to start a new account and it&rsquo;s private and just for my friends or family.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">How did Code Mode come about? [21:18]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">We ended up shutting down the BeatCamp platform. At this time, I was working on a freelance contract and I realized that coding was a domain that I was very familiar with. I came back home to set the foundation for the company and when I flew back, that is how Code Mode started. I started working on things that we would need to do a formal launch.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What was it like when you told your parents about your decision and how did they take that?

So in addition to teaching how to start coding, I will also talk about what you should learn first, in what order should you learn things like frontend, backend and data science. How to learn in a way that you actually remember and understand what you&rsquo;re doing and don&rsquo;t lose motivation and quit.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Note, there is no one right way to do anything. But I&rsquo;ve learnt that it&rsquo;s annoying when you ask someone how to do X and they give you 3 different alternatives, but don&rsquo;t commit and make a recommendation on which one to do. So I am going to write this article in an opinionated way by showing you different alternatives and telling you which one to pick. Again, there is no right way but at least we can spend less time debating between X and Y and spend more time actually building cool stuff.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Why Coding is Important</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Software engineering is one of the few jobs I can think of that has both a good quality of life and it pays well. Most well paying jobs like investment banking or working on an oilfield, usually require you to work long hours in a high-stress environment. While jobs that typically have better work-life balance, like a teacher or accountant, also typically have modest salaires.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7R2PNfoEVYHeXqbu\" data-image-id=\"0*7R2PNfoEVYHeXqbu\" data-width=\"704\" data-height=\"484\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/Google-Software-Engineer-US-Salaries-EJI_IE9079.0,6_KO7,24_IL.25,27_IN1.htm?experienceLevel=LESS_THAN_ONE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/Google-Software-Engineer-US-Salaries-EJI_IE9079.0,6_KO7,24_IL.25,27_IN1.htm?experienceLevel=LESS_THAN_ONE\">Glassdoor Salary for Google Software Engineer with No experience</a></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you get a software engineering job at a big tech company like Google, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/Google-Software-Engineer-US-Salaries-EJI_IE9079.0,6_KO7,24_IL.25,27_IN1.htm?experienceLevel=LESS_THAN_ONE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/Google-Software-Engineer-US-Salaries-EJI_IE9079.0,6_KO7,24_IL.25,27_IN1.htm?experienceLevel=LESS_THAN_ONE\">you can make about $120K base salary and $16k bonus with 0&ndash;1 years of experience</a>. That means, straight out of university you can be making a six-figure salary! There are actually quite a few jobs where you can make six figures out of university but few companies offer the same work life balance, low stress environment as a software engineer at a big tech company.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">We all know that money isn&rsquo;t everything, allegedly. But programming can improve the quality of your life in a lot of other ways. Most importantly, it can give you a lot of freedom. You can learn how to use or write software that can make your life easier, ranging from gmail extensions to automate your email to scripts to help you get data on something you find interesting.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Even if you aren&rsquo;t working at a big tech company. Learning programming can allow you to travel the world and work from anywhere while still writing code as a full time remote worker or a freelance developer.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you have an idea for a software or service you want to build, instead of trying to convince or pay someone to help you build it, you can just go ahead and build it yourself.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Understanding How You Learn and Why You Might&nbsp;Quit</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of the biggest roadblocks for me when I first started programming was figuring out the best way to learn. I think the best way to learn coding and almost anything is by doing. Basically this means, thinking of something you want to build, finding a tutorial on how to do it then just follow the tutorial word for word. Once you feel comfortable with how things are working, you can start gradually adding more and more variations until you feel comfortable with what you have built.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Most problem solving nowadays is basically just thinking of a clever way to translate your problem into a google query that returns a useful result. You should also experiment and see if you learn better through written blog posts, books or videos. I recommend trying all three and see which method helps you learn new concepts the quickest.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A big part of learning how to learn, is understanding what prevents you from learning new things. A big part of this is losing motivation. A lot of my tips will have strategies that will keep you motivated and trick yourself into keep on learning, even (especially) when you feel like quitting.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">What Tools Should You Use To&nbsp;Code</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I think the best development machine is a Macbook Air. I myself have a 15 inch Macbook Pro because that&rsquo;s what I had at my last internship and really enjoyed using it. But at my internship last summer, they gave me a Macbook Air, which is surprisingly quite powerful for development and very light so I recommend getting a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2FVGod4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://amzn.to/2FVGod4\">13 inch Macbook Air</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Now some of you already think I&rsquo;m being very elitist/ blas&eacute; for suggesting you buy a $1200 laptop, which is obviously very expensive. Fortunately, for less than a quarter of the price of a Macbook, you can get <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2TfZSwF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://amzn.to/2TfZSwF\">this wonderful laptop</a> called a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.google.com/chromebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.google.com/chromebook/\">Chromebook</a>. Chromebooks are basically laptops running Chrome OS so most of the applications are running in the cloud via a web browser and you can use online IDEs like <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/\">Cloud 9</a> to write code. I found one for <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2V1ksm1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://amzn.to/2V1ksm1\">$285 on Amazon</a> and even a fancy touch screen one only costs <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2LxXkqC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://amzn.to/2LxXkqC\">$649</a>. Even, if you don&rsquo;t get a Chromebook. Check out cloud 9, it&rsquo;s a very powerful tool.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Other than that, any laptop should be fine. I personally prefer unix based machines as I find Windows difficult to work with but to each their own, so just pick a laptop and get to work.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I strongly recommend using <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a> to save all your coding projects. Here is a very good <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/\">tutorial on getting started with git and Github</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Types of&nbsp;Coding</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There are many types of coding: web development, mobile app development, hardware programming etc. If you are a beginner, then you should probably start with either web development or mobile app development. I think you should start with web development because when you are just starting the most important thing is shipping quickly.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">When you first start coding, it is very easy to get discouraged, distracted by installation and setup or be overwhelmed with all the different options. With web development you can write a simple web app and deploy it to a live url within minutes. You can also update very frequently, don&rsquo;t have to worry about device specific features and can share what you&rsquo;ve made with friends and family very quickly. This allows you to try new things quicker, thus learning quicker and see the fruits of your labor before you get discouraged.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I also think that we are moving from a mobile app world to a web app world. People don&rsquo;t want to install another app, it&rsquo;s hard to get discovered through app stores, you have to build for two devices etc. You can see <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"blog/tomiwa/how-to-build-websites-that-work-without-internet-using-angular-service-workers-and-firebase-lets-keep-in-touch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/how-to-build-websites-that-work-without-internet-using-angular-service-workers-and-firebase-lets-keep-in-touch\">this article</a> for why <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"blog/tomiwa/why-we-chose-angular-over-react-and-django-over-ruby-on-rails-for-atila-the-essential-software-startup-techstack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/why-we-chose-angular-over-react-and-django-over-ruby-on-rails-for-atila-the-essential-software-startup-techstack\">web is better than mobile for most applications</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">What Languages Should You&nbsp;Learn</h3>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*I0x8PpHRSwNcTjZB\" data-image-id=\"0*I0x8PpHRSwNcTjZB\" data-width=\"599\" data-height=\"577\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#most-popular-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#most-popular-technologies\">Stack Overflow Most Popular Technologies 2018</a></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I think the two languages you should learn are Javascript and Python. Starting with Javascript.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Javascript will be necessary for most front end web frameworks and Python is used frequently in backend and data science applications.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I generally break down software development into three phases. Front end, backend and data science. Two years ago, I would have just said frontend and backend engineering but I&rsquo;ve noticed that data science is becoming an increasingly important part of every application we interact with. If you are just starting out I think the best place to start is by focusing on front end web development. By creating something that you can easily deploy, play with and show others, this will keep you motivated to keep learning more. There are also less set up steps and a lower learning curve than backend or data science.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Front End Development</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I learnt the hard way that the best way to start building is by taking something that already works and add your own modification instead of reinventing the wheel. So when building websites, I recommend using an existing framework/library such as Angular, React, Vue.js etc. See <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://tomiwa.ca/schedy/schedy.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://tomiwa.ca/schedy/schedy.php\">one of my first websites</a> which I made in pure html/css/js and PHP, making my life harder for NO reason.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I started using Angular because we used that at a course at my university. I still like Angular as they have a very well defined way of doing things. I even wrote <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"blog/tomiwa/why-we-chose-angular-over-react-and-django-over-ruby-on-rails-for-atila-the-essential-software-startup-techstack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/why-we-chose-angular-over-react-and-django-over-ruby-on-rails-for-atila-the-essential-software-startup-techstack\">an entire article</a> for why I chose to build <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"../../\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://atila.ca/\">my startup</a> using Angular. With all that being said, I think you should start learning how to build websites using React.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Again, all languages have pros and cons, you can read <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://medium.com/@TechMagic/reactjs-vs-angular5-vs-vue-js-what-to-choose-in-2018-b91e028fa91d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@TechMagic/reactjs-vs-angular5-vs-vue-js-what-to-choose-in-2018-b91e028fa91d\">this article</a> or <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://medium.com/zerotomastery/react-vs-angular-vs-vue-who-wins-in-2019-5d9acd0843e8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/zerotomastery/react-vs-angular-vs-vue-who-wins-in-2019-5d9acd0843e8\">this one</a> comparing different javascript frameworks. It is easy to waste time debating which one to pick (talking from experience). I will simplify all these arguments by saying that start with learning React because it is the most popular Javascript framework (<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/stargazers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/stargazers\">as measured by Github star</a>s) so it has the most jobs and freelance contracts available (though also the most competition). Also, because there are so many users, there are more people contributing to the open source React codebase to fix bugs faster and add more features.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The best way to learn React is to build projects in React. The best way to build projects in React is to find tutorials of things you want to build, follow it word for word and just copy and paste. Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand what you are copy and pasting. You will gradually learn the theory behind the WHY of how things work when you encounter a bug or decide to add a modification. This might be an unorthodox way of learning but I have found that for me this is fastest way to learn new ideas, ship products with the most SPEED and I think it might work for you as well.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Here is an <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/\">awesome list of React projects</a> that <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://daveceddia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://daveceddia.com/\">Dave Ceddia</a> has created to start learning React. Here are my top 3 projects to start learning React:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-todo-app-in-react-9bd29054566b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-todo-app-in-react-9bd29054566b\">Simple To-do List</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/\">Dave Ceddia&rsquo;s Practice Projects</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://serverless-stack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://serverless-stack.com/\">Serverless Stack React</a> &mdash; A bit more advance, full stack web app, build this after completing 3 other tutorials</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The most important skill you need to learn at this stage is problem solving and persistence. Or as I like it &ldquo;how to effectively type things into Google&rdquo;. If you are a complete beginner, there is a high chance that you might literally get stuck on step one. Don&rsquo;t get discouraged, just copy and paste whatever they ask you to do that doesn&rsquo;t make sense into Google and add a &ldquo;How to&rdquo;. For example, if a tutorial says &ldquo;clone the tutorial from Github&rdquo; just Google &ldquo;how to clone from Github&rdquo; or even &ldquo;what is Github&rdquo;. Another piece of advice is that if you get an error and you don&rsquo;t know what it means, just copy the first 5&ndash;10 words of the error message, into Google and remove project-specific nouns.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The important thing is that when you are first starting out, every problem you are about to face has likely already been encountered before and because the internet is so awesome, the answer is probably on the internet somewhere. You just need to be clever about how to ask good questions. Incidentally, asking good questions is in my opinion a top 3 life skill (charisma and drive/optimism are the other 2) but I digress.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">When you have finished making a project, I recommend you do two things: One, share it with the world ( or just friends and family) and two, teach people how you made it. There are two reasons for this. We are social creatures and the idea of showing people what you&rsquo;ve built will motivate you to make sure you produce something that is good quality. Secondly, if you have supportive friends and family, they will react positively to what you made, motivating you to make more cool things to get that feeling again.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I recommend teaching other people what you&rsquo;ve just learnt because by teaching other people, you find the gaps in your own knowledge which helps you understand the concept better and you can do something nice for other people. Note that teaching doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean literally teaching someone by tutoring them one-on-one or giving a lecture. Simply writing a blog post, making a slide deck on how you built something or recording a video of yourself while you explain how you built something, will still have the same effect and is less socially demanding and time consuming.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Save all your work to Github. For the first 1 or 2 projects I will allow you to cheat and not use Github as the learning curve will discourage a lot of people to quit before they even start. But once you have built one or 2 projects, you NEED to start using Github. Learning it is a bit annoying at first, but it will make your life so much easier in the long run.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Here are 3 resources you can use to start learning Git:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/\">Official Github Hello World Guide</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners\">An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners (Tutorial)</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/\">GitHub For Beginners: Don&rsquo;t Get Scared, Get Started</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Back End Development</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Back end engineering is a very interesting space as this is where a lot of the business value and technologies really start to differentiate themselves. For example, Google and Bing&rsquo;s homepage (front end) look relatively similar,their backend infrastructure is vastly different. That backend is why Google search is a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/visualising-size-google-bing-yahoo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/visualising-size-google-bing-yahoo/\">$59 billion/year (2013)</a> product compared to Bing&rsquo;s <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/visualising-size-google-bing-yahoo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/visualising-size-google-bing-yahoo/\">$3.2 billion/year (2013)</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*olMNDliouzVkSYrg\" data-image-id=\"0*olMNDliouzVkSYrg\" data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"400\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This graph is a bit misleading. Since Google has other products like Youtube but majority of their revenues come from search</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The best way to start with backend development is by building a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API\">REST API </a>server that can send data to various clients based on their actions. For example, here is <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://atila-7.herokuapp.com/api/scholarships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://atila-7.herokuapp.com/api/scholarships/\">a simple REST API</a> I built for serving scholarships information and here is some of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/atilatech/atila-api-demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://github.com/atilatech/atila-api-demo\">the source code</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I recommend you start by learning python and you use a framework like <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> to help speed up your learning process. I recommend python because:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Python is one of the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://hackernoon.com/top-3-most-popular-programming-languages-in-2018-and-their-annual-salaries-51b4a7354e06\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://hackernoon.com/top-3-most-popular-programming-languages-in-2018-and-their-annual-salaries-51b4a7354e06\">most popular programming languages</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">You can start coding right away from the command line</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">The syntax is very intuitive and matches speaking english</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Python is used extensively in data science so if you decided to do more ML projects, the learning curve will be easier</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The two frameworks I recommend for learning python are <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/\">Flask</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a>. I recommend building your first 1 or 2 python projects in Flask, then as you feel more comfortable start building apps with Django. The <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.django-rest-framework.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.django-rest-framework.org/\">Django Rest Framework</a> is an excellent framework that can then be used to build REST APIs. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> is another popular choice.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Start by building a very simple REST API server, which takes some information from the user and sends some information back. For example, the demo API has 2 functions: Display a list of scholarships and search for scholarships based on the user query. You can then gradually add more complex functionality.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">To keep you engaged, I recommend building a REST API that serves data on a topic which you are interested in. For example, if you are interested in basketball you can build an API that displays the 5 starters in every NBA team and their points, rebound and assists per game. Then allow users to query the API by position or points per game. You can use the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/\">NBA API</a> to get stats for the NBA or just google &ldquo;X api&rdquo; to find data on whatever topic interests you.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You can then combine that with the front end development skills to make a mobile web app to allow users to research NBA players. Then you can use your data science skills and Tensorflow image recognition so if you take a picture of an NBA player, it tells you who the player is and the statistics for that player.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Here are five great tutorials to start learning, Flask, Django and Django Rest Framework:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/\">Official Flask Tutorial&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(Also here is: <a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/flask/flask-production-recipes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A more advanced tutorial on deploying flask applications</a>)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world\">Miguel Grinberg&rsquo;s Flask Tutorial</a> &mdash; absolutely amazing!

The really great opportunities will be available to people who are solving the most complex, business value-add problems. I think that the most complex problems that have the highest ROI are in the field of data science.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1x-p5QOBJUTHzd5y\" data-image-id=\"0*1x-p5QOBJUTHzd5y\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"423\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The GREAT, Benjamin Franklin reading a machine learning ebook. Airpods hidden by wig.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This is also the least beginner friendly topic as most people in this industry have at least a Master&rsquo;s or PhD. However, one of my role models, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin\">Benjamin Franklin</a>, finished his schooling at age 10, didn&rsquo;t even graduate high school and he invented the lightning rod, bifocals and other cool stuff. So if you are willing to learn, and experiment you can do very well in this field.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">My preferred method of learning primarily involves blindly copy and pasting machine learning tutorials. Then I gradually modify and mix different tutorials together until I actually understand what I&rsquo;m doing and what is happening at a deeper level. Once I understand a machine learning concept I also try to write about it or give a short talk about what I learnt, this helps me crystallize my knowledge and other people can learn something useful as well.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*aUVkPNyDg-KxPrQg\" data-image-id=\"0*aUVkPNyDg-KxPrQg\" data-width=\"1334\" data-height=\"1000\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Me giving <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://tomiwa.ca/talks/ml.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://tomiwa.ca/talks/ml.html\">a talk about Machine Learning</a> at a my previous internship with <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://jobs.rbc.com/ca/en/amplify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://jobs.rbc.com/ca/en/amplify\">RBC Amplify,</a> July 18 2017</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A good website to start with that I really like is <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://pythonprogramming.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://pythonprogramming.net/\">pythonprogramming.net</a>. Follow one of those tutorials and once you have completed the tutorial, try to make a slight modification to the final project. Keep doing this for various tutorials and try to read wikipedia or google interesting concepts you come across. This way the concepts and science and math you learn are more likely to be remembered by your brain as you would have applied them to create a practical project.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Another site that you can checkout out is <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/\">Machine Learning Mastery</a>.

So many of us at Western [University] hold the Ivey business school in a really high regard. I&rsquo;m in the program myself. But you actually chose no to take up your advanced entry status (AEO) and not go into the Ivey program, why did you decide to go that route? [7:45]</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Annie Zhang: That&rsquo;s a really good question. I think in hindsight it seems like a very obvious decision but I know for a lot of you who are still in school or pre-Ivey this sound like the craziest decision ever. I guess the context to how I made that decision was after going to Western from a very artsy background, I felt completely like a fish out of water, especially in first year. I had a lot of interesting experiences but they were not relevant at all to the career path that Ivey was sort of pushing me on. Also, comparing myself to a lot of my peers who also had AEO status, everyone seemed extremely suave, everyone was incredible at networking and could have the perfect networking pitch in their sleep. They also had a ton of relevant experience in high school to prepare them for business school. I just didn&rsquo;t have any knowledge of any of that.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">To add on to it, when I started to engage myself with business clubs and opportunities around business, I just didn&rsquo;t find my stride within it. I felt like a lot of the activities and the clubs were extremely structured and formal. It really felt like it was pushing people along a pretty established path of what you should do and here is the output that you&rsquo;re going to get from it. That is when I realized that I tend to thrive more in flexible environments where there is a lot of ambiguity and a lot of problem solving that can be involved. I tend to think a bit more non-linearly and I hate structured environments. A lot of these environments made me feel uncomfortable and completely like a fish out f water.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">So throughout my first year and second year, I was really trying to find my passion and understand whether or not going to business school is actually a good idea. What really got me out of my confusion, I went to this one even that was held by the Nspire Innovation network. Which was this large b-z tech non-profit in Canada. That introduced me to the world of technology and entrepreneurship. Something that I knew nothing about. I think It was through all of second year that I was leading the Western Chapter of Nspire that I Realized that probably entrepreneurship and innovation was where I wanted to go.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Your question is why did I turn down Ivey Business School. There is a lot of context building to drive towards the ultimate decision. But in the summer going into 3rd year I also worked for a startup called Brainstation. It was actually a company where three out of the four founders were ivey Grads. I had so much fun the entire year with the startup, I learned so much. I really felt like that was the environment that I belonged in, I even started a blog that summer where I interviewed a bunch of entrepreneurs and creators.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Every single conversation that I had was so engaging. I really felt like those were the people that I belonged with. So I had an awesome experience at a startup that I felt super engaged in, I really learned a lot and I wanted to do more of. I was also surrounded by three co founders of that company that had gone to ivey. WHen I asked them hey do you guys think its a good idea for me to pursue ivey. Them knowing who I was and what I was interested in and what I was passionate about they actually suggested against it. Not that I was going to choose otherwise had they not suggested that. But&hellip;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: It was more of a validation of what you already wanted to do.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">AZ: Exactly. And the final piece&hellip; Again there&rsquo;s a lot of context and I feel like I&rsquo;m really trying to wrap it in a tight little answer. I did have an alternative to going to Ivey that I felt was even more compelling. Towards the end of summer of second year, I had worked for brainstation which is basically a development bootcamp and I was able to pick up on web development skills. They were also thinking about expanding Brainstation to London and I was like wow that&rsquo;s super cool. Maybe I have an opportunity to lead the expansion of the company to a new city. Another opportunity was that I got the senior vice president role for NSpire which is this biz tech non profit that I talked about. Throughout my entire time with nspire it&rsquo;s given me so much exposure to the industry. So many of the executive members of Nspire were working at cool tech companies or ideas and startups and I felt like that was actually providing a really good network for me to excel at my career within startups and tech. Then I was also working on really cool projects on the side because I had picked up on web development, ios and design skills over the summer at Brainstation. I was doing side gigs and building websites for people as well. I just felt like that were were so many things that I could be working on that was going to accelerate my carer. If I had chosen to go to ivey I wouldn&rsquo;t have time to pursue any of these alternatives and these alternatives were many more compelling and aligned to what I wanted to do in the future rather than going to Ivey.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: that was awesome.

There is a lot of context to why that is suitable for me but I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest people to not go to Ivey. It&rsquo;s a great school, I think you learn a lot and get a lot of networking from that opportunity. You really have to understand and critical think about your decision before you make it.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: Well Said, well said.

I think I tried to do a few practice mocks at first just without any practice or preparation what I was able to deliver so that I had a baseline understanding of what internally I had as my knowledge base. Second, was actually having a lot of discussions around relevant topics. I find that whenever you do mock interviews you tend to be in a very high pressure situation where you&rsquo;re kind of having fight or flights responses and you&rsquo;re really just trying to say the perfect thing and not allowing yourself to think through your answers and get creative and new opinions or perspective on things. So I actually just had a lot of conversations about the industry with people. I would just call somebody and be like Hey let&rsquo;s talk about Messenger. Why messenger is good, why it&rsquo;s bad, what can they be doing to make it better, what are opportunities in the industry, all of that. That really got my brain fired up on interesting ideas that are creative and out there and really pushed the boundaries of what I thought about regularly. That gave me the vocabulary of knowledge around the industry that could supplement a lot of my answers.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I think the final step was just looking at all the questions that people were posting on glassdoor, figuring out what was the best structure to go about those answers. There are a lot of product management interview books out there and they provide you a lot of frameworks. I think what is important is to understand the value of each framework and what in context it becomes the most valuable and actually being very versatile in how you apply different parts of the framework to a different part of the question.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">A lot of the times I wouldn&rsquo;t actually answer a full question in a specific framework. I would just think about &ldquo;Okay, if someone asks me this question, what are they looking for and what is the best structure in framing the problem, framing the solution and how you&rsquo;re going to execute on the solution&rdquo;. And then obviously the practising part which is mocking with as many people as possible so that you don&rsquo;t get too nervous during the actual interview.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: Apart from glass door, if I was to do a mock interview for a example, where is a good place for me to find mock interview questions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">[Annie refers to the following book as Code and Deconquer by Jeremy Lim but the actual name is&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #0c93e4;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2sXQMZX\">Decode and Conquer by Lewis Lin</a>]</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">AZ: There is this guy, I think his name is Jeremy Lim, I could be wrong, the book called Code and Deconquer was one of the really good books that he wrote.

I think just generally, compared to historically bad times for tech companies, this is pretty bad. I would be definitely lying to say that employee morale is not down, there is a lot of contention within the company as well. The same way that privacy issues or Russian involvement and things like that affect the greater public, employees will also perceive it in similar ways, they just have a bit more context. The process that we tend to go through as a company is that leadership is very communicative and they are very responsible. They understand how difficult a lot of these issues are and sometimes how unreasonable the press can be. But they are patient about what it is that they have to do to take control of the situation and ensure that their employees do feel included and are able to address their questions and concerns.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">So pretty much actually just by default, Mark Zuckerberg host a Q and A every single week.

Which means that it&rsquo;s incredibly open and really easy to disseminate information and contribute to the dialogue. So if you have an issue about the integrity of our platform and how we are serving ads and whether or not we are serving legitimate ads for examples. There are tons of groups that you can participate, raise your concerns, questions and hopefully get some sort of results from leadership or you can figure out your own way to tackle the problem.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">That kind of segues to the last piece which is that the first day at Facebook, we got this laptop sticker saying this is your company now and quite frankly it&rsquo;s true. Facebook is going through a hard time, as an employee you may not feel great about everything that&rsquo;s been covered about the company. But at the same time you&rsquo;re an active contribute in the company and you can stand there and complain and be dissatisfied or upset about leadership not taking as much action or responsibility for a lot o things that are being called out. Or you can take action towards fixing the problem. Whether in a small way or in a big way if your product area is actually more overlapping. I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been happening internally at Facebook.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">For me it&rsquo;s actually a more interesting time and I really like being at facebook at this time because that&rsquo;s when there is a lot more challenges and more complexity to how we make decisions.

I do have good faith in leadership of what they think is right and always taking the best action do do what is right.

My boyfriend and I did this thing most of last year where every single date that we went on had to be a pun. So that not only get really creative with things that we could do but it also forced us to do really dumb things that did not need to be done but just for the sake of completing the pun we would do it. So one example was that we got marinated. Basically we went across the Golden Gate bridge to Marin Headlands for a hike and then we went to the marina district in San Francisco to get marinara sauce on our pasta. And then we went to a salon or hot tub and got marinated. So that was really fun, I think we are really running out of steam with these pun dates so we have to figure out something else fun.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I would say another latest obsession is&hellip; I have expressed the fact that I am interested in pursuing a startup in the future. I think that right now the market for startups is pretty saturated to be honest. Some of the most successful startups that are up and coming right now are all trying to solve very very niche problems. Like another facebook is probably not going to be coming out within the next market cycle but things like better insurance solutions or how to&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #0c93e4;\" href=\"https://www.goproperly.com/\">optimize the real estate industry</a>&nbsp;is kind of where the startup movement is going.

Unconventional needs that are not being met, etc and just kind of accumulating. So that&rsquo;s my new obsession</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h3 id=\"general-advice-and-how-to-develop-self-awareness\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\">General Advice and How to Develop Self Awareness</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: So final question now is general advice or anything you want to tell people. Reflecting back on the last 20-something years of your life. What is something you want to tell your younger self or general advice? [1:01:20]</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">AZ: I think the biggest advice that I would give to people and it&rsquo;s been a consistent theme throughout our conversation is just to develop good self-awareness and critical thinking skills approaching the decisions that you make in life. I think good self awareness will prevent yourself from doing things that are not either good for your well being or a good use of your energy. It&rsquo;s going to allow you to go on the path that you should go on much more earlier. You&rsquo;re not just going to know what you want to do off the bat and it takes a lot of experience. Sometimes I&rsquo;m questioning what I&rsquo;m doing and always questioning if I&rsquo;m doing the right thing.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">But to have that constant reflection process and taking back your reflections and applying it to your life is super important. The critical thinking part is super important. Contrary to what everyone is telling you is good or contrary to what other people believe is true. Really analyzing whether or not that is true or is true to and really making sense for you. If its not, you know take your own lens on it and create your own perspective on things.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The other thing that I would suggest to people is really be a good person in general. I know networking is a huge thing for people in school or early career folks but quite frankly you&rsquo;re not going to engage with everybody that you&rsquo;ve had a networking chat or coffee with. I think it&rsquo;s better to develop lasting relationships and I think the best relationships that are formed are situations where you have to work with somebody towards a common goal or interact with someone in some ways. People that you&rsquo;re working on in projects or you&rsquo;re manager at work. Or someone you see is doing really cool things and you decide to follow them around. I think those are the more meaningful interactions that you can have and I would push you to foster more of that and continue to maintain those relationships, rather than constantly seeking out to develop new but maybe not as strong of networks.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Anything else&hellip;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: I was going to say that the point you made about self-awareness is a very good point. I don&rsquo;t know if the question I&rsquo;m about to ask has an answer but how can someone develop or improve their self-awareness? [1:04:10]</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">AZ: That is a super tricky question because the space that I work in. We use machine learning and artificial intelligence is becoming a big part of video, video recognition, classification all of that. For those of you who are geeks out there, self awareness is actually one of the hardest principles to crack within computer science because once an entity is able to gain self-awareness that&rsquo;s kind of what we define as reaching almost an humanist level. I feel like I&rsquo;m really going on a tangent here but&hellip;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: Yeah, that question was meant more as a conclusion, not to go on another tangent. But if you have something o add, you&rsquo;re going on a really good point. I feel bad for currint you off now.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">AZ: I think personally I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m actually super self-aware. I could be delusional and I could be reflecting on facts that are not true and taking in signals that are representative of the world or modelling the world correctly.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I would say that to develop more self awareness I think you just need to try to as objectively as possible look at situations and experiences that you&rsquo;ve had, identify variables that were part of the situation and look at what you did in that situation, and what was the result of that situation. Also if you were to play that scene over again and if you tried something differently, what would have changed given similar variables or if a different variable changed. Just playing simulations around your life and scenarios that have happened in your life is one good way to start. I think the other way is diversifying the signals that you get from understanding yourself and your actions.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Even though you can be journaling at a coffee shop for six hours about this recent interaction you had with a coworker that was negative. You only have your perspective on how you perceive that situation. But if you have a third party that can give their perspective on the situation, they can offer another perspective that is also valuable and has more novel insights. That takes away from you just thinking from what you&rsquo;re doing and also getting other people to tell you what you&rsquo;re doing. But I think that is a very overly analytical way to approach the situation. But quite frankly, that&rsquo;s how I try to be better at being self awareness.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times,serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TA: I like that. I would;&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s overly analytical. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the right amount of analytical. To build on your question as well. Something else you can do that I try to do, to help me develop my self awareness is reading up on cognitive biases. There&rsquo;s this book, Influence by Robert Cialdini there&rsquo;s also someone I love called Charlie Munger [he has an amazing&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #0c93e4;\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws\">talk on cognitive biases</a>&nbsp;(<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #0c93e4;\" href=\"https://www.allencheng.com/25-cognitive-biases-charlie-munger/\">summary of the talk</a>)]. So just Google different cognitive biases and see which ones you used when you made decisions in the past and that&rsquo;s another great way to develop self awareness.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>",

I liked computer science, i was taking classes in high school . I went to Earl Haig. My ninth grade tech teacher knew that I liked it and was decent at it.

I encourage people to go into programs that they actually like and they have a passion for.

It&rsquo;s definitely to strive for and something you wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; see elsewhere. And having the experience of taking care of other people, it takes you out of your own problems.

At the beginning of my university I worked at a mouse lab doing wet lab work. For my thesis [project I worked at a bioinformatics lab getting into more computational work. Also, my degree was specifically an honours specialization in computational biochemistry so I was like okay if I don&rsquo;t get into medical school at least it has the word computer in the name so maybe I can do that. So I applied to google summer of code. There was a lab there, I believe bader lba from U of T that had an open source project called medsavant and some f the doctors at sick Kids used it because the kids have genetic disorders. So they can use the software to find what kind of single point mutations the kids might have and what protein/metabolic pathways that can affect,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So I signed up for that lab so because it was something I had some experience in, even though it was my first paid programming gig, I was able to get into there. Then the summer afterwards I was referred for actual google. So I interned there in the middle of my master&rsquo;s degree and then after graduating my master&rsquo;s degree I ended up at Pinterest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: Why did you decide to do a master&rsquo;s degree?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Ruth: At the end of my fourth year, I knew that I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into medical school for the second time.

The master&rsquo;s degree was programming because it was bioinformatics. Only a bit of wet lab work doing PCRs and DNA but most of it was programming. So during the master&rsquo;s I was able to intern at Google and do Google Summer of Code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: So you intern at Google a couple of times and you get a sign back offer to go back full time?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Ruth: After my internship, I did the exit interviews and I totally bombed one of them. So I didn&rsquo;t get a regular full time offer.

At the hackathon, three was the Andreessen Horowitz talent agency looking for student to put in their talent pool that they would refer to the startups they would invest in. So one of the MLH staff referred me for that and they got me in touch with Pinterest. I also went to Grace Hopper, which was funded by Google, after my internship, they paid for me to go to Grace Hopper and I was able to get some more interviews that way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I did onsite and Facebook, Uber, Dropbox and Pinterest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: Did you get offers to any of those companies or was it only Pinterest?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Ruth: I got an offer for Uber but didn&rsquo;t end up taking it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: Why did you pick Pinterest over Uber</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Ruth: [thinks]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: if it&rsquo;s money you can say money.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Ruth: [laughs] Definitely money, definitely money.

I was like the reason I really like this position at Pinterest is because its software at scale. I feel like if I&rsquo;m going to make an outsize impact there&rsquo;s only a few fields that allow for that. So software at scale is one of those. For example, what we&rsquo;re doing at Pinterest where there&rsquo;s thousands of servers but there&rsquo;s only one or dozen site reliability engineers so you basically have to automate and build systems to manage everything. That&rsquo;s software at scale.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Other fields you can make an impact are shipping logistics.

I decided that I wanted to do that in summer of 2016. The first project I wanted to try my hand at manufacturing was the grow bucket. This was based off space buckets, which is a very popular subreddit. Where there is a community of people who grow mostly marijuana, but you can grow anything. Some people grow cherry tomatoes, hot peppers, that kind of thing, inside 5 gallon buckets. You install lights, fan, maybe a carbon filter and then you grow inside.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So I wanted to make a kit that was affordable, kind of a DIY kit. I was using buckets that I got from local bakeries, so they were food save, i just had to clear them out. I bought enough for a 100 kits or maybe 50 kits and then because I was buying the lightbulb and extension cord etc. in bulk I was able to get my cost down to $30 and I wanted to sell the kit for $50 and I went to maker faire. I think the problem is that people don&rsquo;t want to do things that are DIY, like buckets that have been used by bakeries before. They want a more finished project. So I sold 1 or two and that was it. I had to recycle the other buckets.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Tomiwa: If someone is in a transition period in grade 12, graduating university, thinking about switching jobs and trying to decide what to do next.

Its okay to figure it out as you go along and the important thing is not to worry too much about if you&rsquo;re doing the right thing.

For me, working for a larger company was great because they have a lot of infrastructure around mentorship and you can work with a lot of senior people. I don&rsquo;t have a CS degree I feel really out of place here, for my master&rsquo;s I was doing scripting in R which is not software engineering.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I do feel like based on the other senior people on my team, as I progress in my career it would be good for me to work at smaller, less operational mature companies to get my chops. But then the way my husband ended up doing it; he had a React textbook and he read it and made a project in React on the side. Then he got hired by Locust 21 , startup in Waterloo, then he got hired by Top Hat then he got his job at Cruise, he&rsquo;s trying to come out to join me because I was in SF for a year.

You put in your application for August or September. You study really hard. You read the bible, which is Cracking the Coding Interview in this context and you just spend a lot of time just grinding on questions. I think it will take a few months to get good. Of studying really hard and forsaking some of your grades because this is more important. And then you go for the coding interview.

I was joining their engineering meetings for a few months. He invited me to go to China with him for a few weeks. I asked my manager, please please can I go.

So I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about products and so one product that Robin my husband bought this year. It&rsquo;s really simple its a device that cooks eggs. So you plug it in, there&rsquo;s only one button, it&rsquo;s the power button. There&rsquo;s this little cup where if you want soft boiled eggs you put in a bit less water, if you want hard boiled eggs you put in more water.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">There&rsquo;s like a little plastic thing that you put the eggs on, it goe up to six eggs.

Their exactly what you want every time and its so low effort. That has been a real inspiration for me. If you eat eggs everyday or every overt day, then this is huge. You are saving so much time and so much effort, so much mental energy of thinking about cooking. Its one product that does one thing, really well. So I&rsquo;m like Okay, that&rsquo;s something where if we have a product, I have to figure out what is it solving and make sure it solves that really well.

I think that started from grade 10. At that point I realized I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and I knew that grade 11 and 12 were very integral years because that was when I had to start applying to different university programs and deciding on a rough career path of what I wanted to pursue. So in grade 10 was when I start just cold calling people and trying to look into different career options. So shadowing opportunities, just doing my own research online and I did a lot of shadowing with different professionals and different types of carers</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: So in grade 10/11 you literally just cold called an optometrist and said can I just watch you for a couple of days?

It&rsquo;s actually not as hard as you think it is. Because for health professionals we all &ndash; or at least I had my own optometrist at the time. So I just walked into her office and I just asked her can I observe you, can I shadow you for an hour.

So focusing more on the undergraduate schools. I knew that for both undergrad and medical school I wanted to stay in Canada preferably Ontario, and so as a result for undergrad programs I only applied to Ontario schools. I was looking into different science programs and the medical sciences program, which is the one I ended up choosing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h3 id=\"getting-rejected-from-mcmaster-health-science\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">Getting Rejected from Mcmaster Health Science</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: I know MacMaster has a very good reputation.

Because I had all my eggs in one basket and when I got the rejection letter I realized: &ldquo;Where am I going to go? What am I going to do?&rdquo;. So I started researching other schools, and I looked into <a title=\"Western&rsquo;s medical science program\" href=\"https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/bmsc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Western&rsquo;s medical science program</a> and it really caught my eye. I did a campus tour there and I just fell in love with the campus and the program was so great because all of the modules that you can choose in upper years and a lot of the course that you pick are focused on the human body and the medical sciences, which is what I wanted to take away from an undergraduate science program.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h3 id=\"what-if-i-don&rsquo;t-get-into-medical-school\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">What if I don&rsquo;t get Into Medical School</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: So now that you get into Western.

That thought has been in my head many times. I had a bit of a mid-undergrad crisis I guess you could call it. Because I just woke up one day and I asked myself, &ldquo;What are you doing. Sure you want to go to medical school but are you sure? If that doesn&rsquo;t work out what are you going to do?&rdquo; I think these are questions every undergrad has to ask themself at every single stage of their education.

I did more emailing, did more cold calls. You know just messaging people, messaging old contacts that you have and just having phone conversations with them is very helpful. Looking into different grad programs, I was looking at Master&rsquo;s programs in healthcare, in quality improvement and even in <a title=\"Ivey[business school]\" href=\"https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ivey[business school]</a>.&nbsp;I was considering pursuing a business degree as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: Wow.

Had I not chosen business in high school, I definitely would have chosen a commerce degree. I just liked it because the business world seemed so exciting. Since I had those 2 interests and I had a bachelor of science already under my wing. I thought that combining business and sciences would have been a really, really great and exciting career path.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: One thing viewers may not know is that you actually did not need to get your undergrad degree before you went to U of T.

At that point I didn&rsquo;t finish my four year bachelor of med sci degree. But I thought about it and decided to take summer courses to finish up a three year major as a bachelor of science. I just wanted to do that because I knew that I spent so many years at Western, I loved what I was studying and I spent so much time at effort walking towards that degree I just didn&rsquo;t want to leave it at that.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">So for me I guess it was a little bit of closure. But also, I think that there are many perks to finishing your degree and having a degree and having that under your name. Just as an example, for medical school at least, you have the option of completing a masters in tandem with your medical school education. And in order to get opportunities like that you need to get a bachelor&rsquo;s degree already.

Every different level of education has different demands from you as a person as well as the curriculum demands. I think the biggest lessons I learned was that of self care and a lot about work life balance. In high school, I was stressed out about the work I had at hand. Then in undergrad I realized that wow high school is such child&rsquo;s play, now this is the real deal, now I am still stressed out. Even in medical school, sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m just a big ball of stress to be honest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">One of the biggest learning curves was that of time management and self care. It&rsquo;s always important, no matter how busy you are, it&rsquo;s always important to put some time in there for yourself, to discover who you are as a person. Even though you are a student, even though you will be a doctor one day, you&rsquo;re always going to be a person as well. Its important to hold on to that, to discover who you are, your personality, what you love and don&rsquo;t love. What your hobbies. Its really important to hold on to that. I think that giving yourself those self care days and being able to hit the reset button really helped motivate me even more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h3 id=\"living-up-to-immigrant-parents&rsquo;-expectations\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">Living Up to Immigrant Parents&rsquo; Expectations</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: As a child of immigrants.

I think growing up, to be completely candid with you, I think I did get a lot of pressure from my parents. But as a result over time, I think I kind of took that and I started to put pressure on myself. Because I wanted to make them proud and I wanted to make them happy because they sacrificed so much for me and I really do appreciate that and I wanted to show them that.

Regardless of where we are in life and what field we&rsquo;re in I think everybody faces that. Burnout I guess you would call it. What helps me, personally what helps me is hitting the reset button and taking those self care days. To take care for yourself and reflect on why you got here in the first place. Why you chose to come to where you are presently. And sometimes it helps if you just think about all that enthusiasm that you had in undergrad and high school. Even reading my medical school application is really motivating for me to get out of bed and go to the library and make my past self proud.

I feel like I&rsquo;m still not fully integrated into the demands of medical school. I still procrastinate like crazy which is awful that&rsquo;s something that I did in high school, and undergrad and told myself I would stop. But, here I am still doing that. So hopefully, second year medical school I can tame that habit a little more.

But if you could ask me now what I want to do I would say family medicine. Because I love how its like the front line practice of medicine and I like how it focuses a lot on and can focus a lot on preventative care.

I hope that at that point I won&rsquo;t just be focused on my clinic or just be focused on my practical skills as a doctor. That I can also integrate my own passions in that practise as well and weekly routine. Weather thats finding a good cause that I&rsquo;m interested in or volunteering some time as a doctor I think that would be really cool.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<h3 id=\"advice-for-aspiring-doctors-and-people-who-want-to-help-others\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.8em 0px; line-height: 1.33;\">Advice for Aspiring Doctors and People Who Want to Help Others</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: Now do you have any final advice for people who are considering a career in the medical field or getting into medical school. Even if they don&rsquo;t want to be a doctor, maybe they don&rsquo;t want to go to medical school. Maybe they just want to help people. What kind of advice would you give them.[16:07]</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">EC: Okay, first for people who are considering going into medicine.[thinks] I think it&rsquo;s very important to establish why you want to go into medical school for one and most importantly why you want to be a doctor. So in order to do that I think a lot of self-reflection is very important. Figuring out who you are why you want to do this as well as gaining some exposure in the field. Ether it&rsquo;s in the hospital or the clinic or whatever. Because really if you commit yourself to this, this is going to be the rest of your life. You have to be very passionate, you have to have a love for learning and a love for what you love for the career to avoid burnout and to keep that motivation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I would also say do some research because applying to medical school, in Ontario, in Canada in the States, wherever can be very competitive. So it&rsquo;s important that you fulfill all the requirements that you have as well as maintaining your own integrity in who you are as a person.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">As for people who just want to be good people and help others. I would say find your passions and just run with them. I would say try to get involved with some leadership roles if you can. Say you find an organization or a volunteer opportunity that you&rsquo;re very interested in, stay there as a volunteer for a little bit and then try to move up in leadership positions as you can, to make the biggest impact that you as a student or you as a person can do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">TA: Emily, thank you for your time.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">Extra Resources:</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><a title=\"U of T Medical School\" href=\"https://md.utoronto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">U of T Medical School</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><a title=\"Western Medical Science\" href=\"https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/bmsc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Western Medical Science</span></a></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><a title=\"McMaster Health Science\" href=\"https://bhsc.mcmaster.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">McMaster Health Science</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><a href=\"search?q=health+science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medical/Health Science Scholarships</a></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><a href=\"search?q=medical+school\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medical School Scholarships</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

When I have internet, it feels like there are infinitely many things competing for my attention. But when I am on a plane for example, and there is no internet connection, the competition for my attention is much less fierce. The 3 things I can usually do is look through my photos, watch a downloaded movie or read an ebook. With service-workers, if you are able to deliver an offline web experience for your users, you are able to get their attention in one of those few moments when the competition for it is least fierce.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.28);\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">After reading this article you will learn, the theory of how service workers work, a short tutorial to apply that theory to make a website that runs without the internet and finally, what this means for the you and future of the internet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.28);\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">I get really excited when talking about service workers so I am going to go on a quick rant on the problem this solves and why this is awesome before I dive into the theory of how service workers work and a coding tutorial.

When your web app asks for resources (images, html files, json API etc.) the service worker gets it for you without needing to ask the internet. In literal terms, it is a javascript file that gets shipped along with the rest of your app with code that tells your app how to intercept network requests and save and get it from your network cache.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.28);\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">Typically, when website is first loaded, the web browser makes a set of requests to the network for the assets that your website needs to run.

The first time you visit a site, in addition to the usual set of index.html, styles.css, main.js etc. files that get requested, the browser also requests a service worker javascript file from your website. This file then gets downloaded and saved to your browser cache. The serviceworker file then downloads, versions and caches all the files in your application to serve it for later.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.28);\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\"><img style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-style: none; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TiexabWzx-dn8KUIrvZryRle3f7LcXg4LqJRBSrHqYajX6-3VB8KpYTlFLuu5mWYo_lBN3qvKKhnUYYoSPQ-N-vrs9WwB8XTmKMEpWLOodrKGmoyexzspLjosPPuESFjqc-IpD0_\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.28);\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.2em 0px;\">This has two very important benefits. As is mentioned in the title, this means that even when your internet connection is down, the website will still work because it never actually has to ask the internet for anything. The service worker, has all the files you will need. Conversely, this also means that even if you do have internet, the application will also run faster. On future website loads, instead of making a full round trip to the network to get the application files. It simply retrieves the files from the browser cache and serves it to the user.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cl-preview-section\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;

Would you describe these ladies as lucky or unlucky?&nbsp;</i></p><p>A few days ago I was on LinkedIn and read&nbsp;<a href=\"http://time.com/money/5332003/stripe-founder-john-collison-youngest-self-made-billionaire/\">an article about the world’s youngest self-made billionaire</a>, 27 year old John Collison from Stripe. In the article he mentioned that his success was a result of&nbsp;“intense application and hard work…But I also think that luck was required too… There are [others] who are smarter and harder-working than us who just didn’t get the same good fortune.”</p><p>As usual, in the comments section people pitched their ideological camps and started arguing. Some said that his success was purely a result of the luck of being a middle-class white male. Others said “Luck does not exist, you can do anything with hard work”. However, like most things in life the truth is a lot more nuanced and is a balance of both sides.</p><p>The luck debate is one that has been brought up many times in all walks of life and while I see people passionately argue both sides, I rarely find a perspective that properly contrasts the strengths and flaws of both arguments. For a long time, I intuitively knew that the short answer was “both”, but I had a hard time articulating my thoughts in a clear, cohesive way. Fortunately, as I write this at 2:53 am in the morning, in a flash of inspiration, I think I have a neat analogy for understanding how luck impacts our life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-04-at-10.27.02-PM.png?resize=700%2C368\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-04-at-10.27.02-PM.png?w=1422 1422w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-04-at-10.27.02-PM.png?resize=300%2C158 300w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-04-at-10.27.02-PM.png?resize=768%2C404 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-04-at-10.27.02-PM.png?resize=700%2C368 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"700\"></figure><p><i>Proof of the Flash of Inspiration&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Flip Card</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine a game called Flip Card. The idea is very simple. There are 4 cards, 2 have a blue dot and 2 have a red dot, they all have identical back sides. The cards are scrambled with their back sides facing up and a card is flipped at random. If it is a blue dot, you win the round. If it’s red, you lose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: In anticipation of people taking the analogy very literally, I want to clarify something. Lose in this context is not a pejorative and I am not calling the losers of a round, a loser personally. I mean lose in the sense of “in a circumstance that most people in society would find less than ideal”. E.g. poor people are not losers but they are “in a circumstance that most people in society would find less than ideal”.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now imagine, if the first round is the birth round and you are currently in the 1700s of America. In this time period, males had a significantly stronger advantage than women. So though there is a 50/50 chance of being born a male. If you flipped the blue dot, you would have gotten lucky, been born a male and won the birth round.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second rule is that different rounds may have different odds. So in round 2, you may have 9 blue cards and 1 red card. Though the odds changed, the rules are the same. If you land on a blue card, you win the round.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward to present day america, where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states\">about 10% of people live below the poverty line</a>.</p><p>In this time period, the poor had a significantly stronger disadvantage than the middle class and above. Again, however, there is a 1/10 chance of being born below the poverty line and losing the round. So in this round you have 9 blue cards and 1 red card. 1 in every 10 player will flip the red card, lose the round and be born poor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We can all have different interpretations for why we got lucky in various rounds and whether we should even call it luck or something else. Religious people believe it’s because we’ve been blessed by God, the superstitious may say its because they knocked on wood 3 times and wore striped socks on the 2nd of the month, the atheists may say “that’s just the way it is”. The important point now is how can we use this mindset to help us in our lives. For this, we introduce the 3rd part of the game.</p><h2>Stacking the Odds</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now imagine if you can impact the number and colors of cards in a given round. First, suppose 20% of entry level jobs make minimum wage or less*. Then in the entry level job round, there are 4 blue cards and 1 red card. Now, it gets interesting.</p><p><i>*In theory and ipso facto, you can’t make less than minimum wage. But I think you will agree that this is a case where theory does not always match up with practice.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this round you can do various tasks to add more cards in the game. For example, going to Harvard may add 8 blue cards, while having a criminal record may add 10 red cards. Notice that though you can impact the odds, the luck element remains. In other words you could go to Harvard, flip red and still end up with a minimum wage job, or you could have a criminal record, flip blue and be a millionaire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Bigger Picture</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the bigger picture, the point is that life is a series of lucky events, some of which are out of our control and some of which we can tip the odds in our favor. The analogy is not perfect (after all, it’s called an analogy for a reason) and you could say that the odds and outcome from previous rounds out of our control affect rounds that are seemingly in our control. For example, while I can control studying hard on the SATs to get into Harvard to get a good job. I can’t control having the income level to attend a school that prepares me well for the SAT or the genes that allows me to easily study and retain information well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, ipso facto, those things are out of my control, so the best thing to do is focus on what things I can control and taking personal responsibility to push myself to continually improve. I think this is the mindset that can best lead to achieving your goals and having a happy life.</p>",

cover letter (i.e. swap the company names). Then when we ask why we aren&rsquo;t getting many responses we are told its because we need to use more &ldquo;action words&rdquo; in the cover letter or change the font size on your resume. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, this doesn&rsquo;t address the real underlying issue. Only relying on resumes and cover letters is ineffective because outside of name dropping the school you went to or an impressive company you worked for, it&rsquo;s really hard to prove why you deserve a chance. So we end up just writing a bunch of corporate jargon and buzzwords that no one actually wants to read. Which is probably why most resumes are never actually seen by humans but by computers scanning for certain &ldquo;keywords&rdquo; or humans scanning for certain &ldquo;buzzwords&rdquo; ;) . These strategies may have worked in the past but in this modern internet age, there is definitely a better way to do this.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #222222; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tangible Proof of Your Merit</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The best way to prove how deserving you are is to make something interesting or useful and share it on the internet.

There is no such thing as being too busy, only priorities. So you don&rsquo;t think allocating time to do this is a priority for you. You see immediate benefit of getting good grades. But you don&rsquo;t see immediate benefit of learning something that you&rsquo;re not getting a grade or getting paid for and you don&rsquo;t see the benefit of sharing something online. Big mistake. In my opinion, in the long term, personal development and developing your network will be the best investment you can make in yourself.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Posting on the Internet is bad.

text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When applying for jobs most of us do the exact same thing: Apply to the same postings as everyone else on the career central portal, send in a resume that is virtually identical to all the other resumes and if we&rsquo;re feeling extra diligent, maybe even write a &ldquo;customized&rdquo; cover letter (i.e. swap the company names). Then when we ask why we aren&rsquo;t getting many responses we are told its because we need to use more &ldquo;action words&rdquo; in the cover letter or change the font size on your resume. </span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, this doesn&rsquo;t address the real underlying issue. Only relying on resumes and cover letters is ineffective because outside of name dropping the school you went to or an impressive company you worked for, it&rsquo;s really hard to prove why you deserve a chance. So we end up just writing a bunch of corporate jargon and buzzwords that no one actually wants to read. Which is probably why most resumes are never actually seen by humans but by computers scanning for certain &ldquo;keywords&rdquo; or humans scanning for certain &ldquo;buzzwords&rdquo; ;) . These strategies may have worked in the past but in this modern internet age, there is definitely a better way to do this.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #222222; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tangible Proof of Your Merit</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The best way to prove how deserving you are is to make something interesting or useful and share it on the internet.

There is no such thing as being too busy, only priorities. So you don&rsquo;t think allocating time to do this is a priority for you. You see immediate benefit of getting good grades. But you don&rsquo;t see immediate benefit of learning something that you&rsquo;re not getting a grade or getting paid for and you don&rsquo;t see the benefit of sharing something online. Big mistake. In my opinion, in the long term, personal development and developing your network will be the best investment you can make in yourself.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Posting on the Internet is bad.

By the time school started in the fall, Atila had a fully functional prototype and we were planning on launching soon. Meanwhile, the Phlock Github repo hadn&rsquo;t been touched in over 2 months. I had been so busy with Atila and Phlock was still so obscure that few people actually knew or cared about it so it had quietly just slid into the abyss. Here are some things I&rsquo;ve learnt from starting a company that disappeared.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">\n<li>Start with Software (It&rsquo;s called Hardware for a Reason)</li>\n<li>Web Apps over Mobile Apps</li>\n<li>Quitting is Underrated</li>\n<li>Share the Journey</li>\n<li>Love the Process</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with Software (It&rsquo;s called Hardware for a Reason)</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">One of my biggest lessons is that if you are a first time entrepreneur I really think you should consider starting with a software as a service company. There are too many variables in a hardware startup that if it&rsquo;s your first time starting a company some of the challenges in hardware will finish your company before you even start, or worse, after you&rsquo;ve started.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">The single biggest challenge is a lack of iteration speed and the long feedback cycles. When you are starting a company you need to be able to have a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, then iterate quickly on the response you get. Starting a company can be so counterintuitive that most of the time it's better to just release something that doesn&rsquo;t even fully work yet just so people can show you why it doesn&rsquo;t work and you can quickly give them a better version.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">However, with hardware you typically have a hypothesis on what the market wants, work on it for a long period of time, then get feedback on it. The problem is, by the time you get the feedback, your company may no longer have money, motivation or market interest to iterate on the feedback.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">The other problem with hardware is that there are too many variables that are out of your control. We entrepreneurs like to be masters of our own destiny and captains of our ship, hardware can turn you into a wimpy leaf. When you start a company, it feels like there are so many little things that can simply breath on you and your company will fall.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Fortunately, with software companies, you have a lot of control over making a product that the market wants and that gives you leverage. With software if something doesn&rsquo;t work it&rsquo;s usually your fault, which is actually a liberating feeling. &nbsp;In hardware there are too many external suppliers, vendors, investors, distributors etc. that have leverage over you and can impact the future of your company.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">My friends often pitch me on business ideas they have and when it involves anything hardware related and they&rsquo;ve never started a company before I often give them the same advice. Keep the same idea you have but think of the subset of that problem which could be solved as a purely software solution through a web or mobile app. Build that first, then once you know you have the ability to deliver a tangible product and more importantly, make something people want, you can start adding the hardware components to your idea.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web Apps over Mobile Apps</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">If I was to redo Atila I would have made the mobile app into a web app or added a \"phlock-lite\" version that was a web app. This advice is not strictly relevant to Phlock because there was a hardware component so a native mobile app was necessary. But I think that the future (actually, back to the future, because the origins of internet and things like&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netscape</a>&nbsp;was in web apps) of software will be delivered through web apps over mobile apps.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">There is a&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"http://blog.tomiwa.ca/building-atila-essential-software-startup-tech-stack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">separate post</a>&nbsp;I wrote on this (see the Progressive Web Apps section), the punchline is that web browsers, javascript and web apps are becoming more powerful at the same time that people are becoming increasingly reluctant to download new apps from app stores. As a startup, many companies take themselves out of the game because people won&rsquo;t download the app before they can even find out if its bad or good.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quitting is Underrated</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">One of the things I learnt from Phlock was a new way of thinking about quitting. There were a couple weeks I kept working on Phlock in the name of &ldquo;finish what you started&rdquo; and &ldquo;never give up&rdquo; but this may have been a mistake. People either quit because something is too hard or what they&rsquo;re doing is taking them down the wrong path. Of course the great jedi mind trick is that many people quit the right path because it&rsquo;s too hard and then they convince themselves that they quit because they were going down the wrong path. I myself have this issue sometimes but something that helps me is asking myself &ldquo;If this was easier, would I still want to do it?&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think I consciously knew I was doing it at the time but in retrospect, that question helped me realize my time was better spent on Atila.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Share the Journey</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">One thing I wish I did more during my work with Phlock was documenting and sharing more of the thoughts I had and the things I made. First, the serendipity of the internet has allowed cool opportunities to come out of people finding the things I have shared. Second, I think documenting my ideas for future generations to see could be pretty cool, I could also use it as a public archive of a snapshot of where my head was at and how my thinking has changed. Finally, I spend a lot of time in open source land and I&rsquo;m always amazed by the stuff that people share on the internet for free and I think giving back to the open source community when I can is a good thing.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I have open sourced&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"https://github.com/ademidun/phlock-public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some of the code I used to build Phlock</a>. Including the java source code for the android app that allowed users to share keys with each other in real time and the code that controlled the microcontroller which locked and unlocked the door deadbolt. There are a lot of files and parsing what can and can&rsquo;t be shared will take a bit of time. So I&rsquo;ll be sharing the code ad-hoc and based on community interest, so if anybody wants me to upload more stuff let me know (<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"mailto:tomiwa@atila.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tomiwa@atila.ca</a>).</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love the Process</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Looking at my folder with all the Phlock code I have this weird mixed emotions of indifference and concern. I spent so much time and cognitive load on Phlock that leaving it to do something is else is kind of sad. But at the same time, I enjoyed building Phlock and I really feel like I left it for a good reason which is why I feel good about my choice.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I really enjoyed the day to day grind and process of building Phlock and the skills that I learnt are effectively an investment in whatever I do next. When I have talks with people about career advice, I often ask them to focus on the median emotion of their decision. In other words, ignoring the emotional high social validation of a prestigious job, think of what the regular, unspectacular day in that life would look like.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Imagine a rainy Monday morning waking up to for a full day of work or a quiet Wednesday afternoon in the office. With Phlock, and now with Atila, there are many days where nothing particularly special happened, except &ldquo;work stuff&rdquo;. Often those are some of the best days and finding happiness in normalcy is something that has helped me a lot, maybe it might help you.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">This post was more divergent than most of my other essays, and most of my other essays are already very divergent. However, I think that by covering a wide range of thoughts, everyone can find a little bit of something that will be relevant to them. Thanks for reading, have a great day.</p>",

A device that let you unlock doors using your phone and share keys with friends in real time.

By the time school started in the fall, Atila had a fully functional prototype and we were planning on launching soon. Meanwhile, the Phlock Github repo hadn&rsquo;t been touched in over 2 months. I had been so busy with Atila and Phlock was still so obscure that few people actually knew or cared about it so it had quietly just slid into the abyss. Here are some things I&rsquo;ve learnt from starting a company that disappeared.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">\n<li>Start with Software (It&rsquo;s called Hardware for a Reason)</li>\n<li>Web Apps over Mobile Apps</li>\n<li>Quitting is Underrated</li>\n<li>Share the Journey</li>\n<li>Love the Process</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with Software (It&rsquo;s called Hardware for a Reason)</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">One of my biggest lessons is that if you are a first time entrepreneur I really think you should consider starting with a software as a service company. There are too many variables in a hardware startup that if it&rsquo;s your first time starting a company some of the challenges in hardware will finish your company before you even start, or worse, after you&rsquo;ve started.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">The single biggest challenge is a lack of iteration speed and the long feedback cycles. When you are starting a company you need to be able to have a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, then iterate quickly on the response you get. Starting a company can be so counterintuitive that most of the time it's better to just release something that doesn&rsquo;t even fully work yet just so people can show you why it doesn&rsquo;t work and you can quickly give them a better version.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">However, with hardware you typically have a hypothesis on what the market wants, work on it for a long period of time, then get feedback on it. The problem is, by the time you get the feedback, your company may no longer have money, motivation or market interest to iterate on the feedback.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">The other problem with hardware is that there are too many variables that are out of your control. We entrepreneurs like to be masters of our own destiny and captains of our ship, hardware can turn you into a wimpy leaf. When you start a company, it feels like there are so many little things that can simply breath on you and your company will fall.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Fortunately, with software companies, you have a lot of control over making a product that the market wants and that gives you leverage. With software if something doesn&rsquo;t work it&rsquo;s usually your fault, which is actually a liberating feeling. &nbsp;In hardware there are too many external suppliers, vendors, investors, distributors etc. that have leverage over you and can impact the future of your company.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">My friends often pitch me on business ideas they have and when it involves anything hardware related and they&rsquo;ve never started a company before I often give them the same advice. Keep the same idea you have but think of the subset of that problem which could be solved as a purely software solution through a web or mobile app. Build that first, then once you know you have the ability to deliver a tangible product and more importantly, make something people want, you can start adding the hardware components to your idea.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web Apps over Mobile Apps</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">If I was to redo Atila I would have made the mobile app into a web app or added a \"phlock-lite\" version that was a web app. This advice is not strictly relevant to Phlock because there was a hardware component so a native mobile app was necessary. But I think that the future (actually, back to the future, because the origins of internet and things like&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape\">Netscape</a>&nbsp;was in web apps) of software will be delivered through web apps over mobile apps.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">There is a&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"http://blog.tomiwa.ca/building-atila-essential-software-startup-tech-stack/\">separate post</a>&nbsp;I wrote on this (see the Progressive Web Apps section), the punchline is that web browsers, javascript and web apps are becoming more powerful at the same time that people are becoming increasingly reluctant to download new apps from app stores. As a startup, many companies take themselves out of the game because people won&rsquo;t download the app before they can even find out if its bad or good.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quitting is Underrated</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">One of the things I learnt from Phlock was a new way of thinking about quitting. There were a couple weeks I kept working on Phlock in the name of &ldquo;finish what you started&rdquo; and &ldquo;never give up&rdquo; but this may have been a mistake. People either quit because something is too hard or what they&rsquo;re doing is taking them down the wrong path. Of course the great jedi mind trick is that many people quit the right path because it&rsquo;s too hard and then they convince themselves that they quit because they were going down the wrong path. I myself have this issue sometimes but something that helps me is asking myself &ldquo;If this was easier, would I still want to do it?&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think I consciously knew I was doing it at the time but in retrospect, that question helped me realize my time was better spent on Atila.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Share the Journey</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">One thing I wish I did more during my work with Phlock was documenting and sharing more of the thoughts I had and the things I made. First, the serendipity of the internet has allowed cool opportunities to come out of people finding the things I have shared. Second, I think documenting my ideas for future generations to see could be pretty cool, I could also use it as a public archive of a snapshot of where my head was at and how my thinking has changed. Finally, I spend a lot of time in open source land and I&rsquo;m always amazed by the stuff that people share on the internet for free and I think giving back to the open source community when I can is a good thing.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I have open sourced&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"https://github.com/ademidun/phlock-public\">some of the code I used to build Phlock</a>. Including the java source code for the android app that allowed users to share keys with each other in real time and the code that controlled the microcontroller which locked and unlocked the door deadbolt. There are a lot of files and parsing what can and can&rsquo;t be shared will take a bit of time. So I&rsquo;ll be sharing the code ad-hoc and based on community interest, so if anybody wants me to upload more stuff let me know (<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"mailto:tomiwa@atila.ca\">tomiwa@atila.ca</a>).</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both; color: #111111; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; line-height: 1.4; font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love the Process</span></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Looking at my folder with all the Phlock code I have this weird mixed emotions of indifference and concern. I spent so much time and cognitive load on Phlock that leaving it to do something is else is kind of sad. But at the same time, I enjoyed building Phlock and I really feel like I left it for a good reason which is why I feel good about my choice.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I really enjoyed the day to day grind and process of building Phlock and the skills that I learnt are effectively an investment in whatever I do next. When I have talks with people about career advice, I often ask them to focus on the median emotion of their decision. In other words, ignoring the emotional high social validation of a prestigious job, think of what the regular, unspectacular day in that life would look like.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Imagine a rainy Monday morning waking up to for a full day of work or a quiet Wednesday afternoon in the office. With Phlock, and now with Atila, there are many days where nothing particularly special happened, except &ldquo;work stuff&rdquo;. Often those are some of the best days and finding happiness in normalcy is something that has helped me a lot, maybe it might help you.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">This post was more divergent than most of my other essays, and most of my other essays are already very divergent. However, I think that by covering a wide range of thoughts, everyone can find a little bit of something that will be relevant to them. Thanks for reading, have a great day.</p>"

But they&rsquo;re often worried about coming across as pretentious or boastful. 30% of the time their humility is a very admirable trait, however the other 70% of the time, I think their modesty robs a lot of people of a lot of value.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I understand where they&rsquo;re coming from though.When I first wrote about&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"blog/tomiwa/how-i-got-interviews-at-google-facebook-and-bridgewater\">How I got interviews at Google, Facebook and Bridgewater</a>, I wanted to remove the part where I mentioned my Google and Bridgewater interviews for two reasons: &nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">\r\n<li>I didn&rsquo;t even end up getting the job</li>\r\n<li>I didn&rsquo;t want to be boastful or become a source of envy for people who didn&rsquo;t get interviews.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">This is a reasonable concern because often on social media when someone posts &ldquo;Excited to start my new job at Google&rdquo;, we all comment &ldquo;nice! congrats!&rdquo; but secretly we&rsquo;re also envious and wonder why we&rsquo;re not the ones making that status. We&rsquo;re not bad people, it&rsquo;s just part of human nature.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">However, I noticed that while I may get envious of someone saying &ldquo;Excited to start my new job at Google&rdquo; on LinkedIn or Facebook (especially fresh after getting the Unfortunately&hellip; email). When I read an article titled, &ldquo;How I got job offers at Google, Facebook &hellip;&rdquo; I feel slightly happier and inspired, even though I myself didn&rsquo;t get job offers at any of these companies. What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">It&rsquo;s very simple. The first example brings value primarily to the poster and the second example brings value primarily to the audience. When you talk about something good you&rsquo;ve done on social media it&rsquo;s mostly just signalling to let people know how awesome you are.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I actually partially understand that because developing your reputation is an important part of society. However, when you tell people about something good you&rsquo;ve done in the context of &ldquo;I did this cool thing. If I can do it, you can do it. Here&rsquo;s how&rdquo; now you&rsquo;re actually helping them and providing a lot of value for them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I go to a well known business school in Canada and I used to get uncomfortable when people would say things like &ldquo;Wow, you got into Ivey, you must be so smart.&rdquo; and I would try to change the subject. &nbsp;Again, I didn&rsquo;t want to be boastful or make people feel bad. Then I realized that there was no reason to change the subject and I would try to tell them something along the lines of &ldquo;If you want to get in, you can do it too. Start by doing X, Y and Z&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Another strategy is that while sharing your accomplishments, you can also be transparent about your weaknesses and challenges you&rsquo;ve faced. Many people that aspire to do what you have done worry that their procrastination, intelligence, physical appearance, anxiety, &nbsp;etc. prevents them from reaching the level that you reached, imagine jf they knew that you experienced the same challenges.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Similarly, one thing I&rsquo;ve underestimated and only recently realized is how inspiring it is to hear the stories of people who look like you, I&rsquo;ve noticed this especially in the female and minority communities. &nbsp;&nbsp;By mentioning that you also struggle with procrastination people begin to think &ldquo;Wow, Sally does so much stuff. I never knew she struggles with procrastination and she&rsquo;s an X just like me. If she can do it, I can do it&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">If your intentions are pure and you don&rsquo;t want to come across as boastful, you&rsquo;re off to a good start because then your writing will naturally be slanted more towards bringing value to the reader. So if you&rsquo;re reading this and think you&rsquo;ve done something which others can learn from I encourage you to share your story with others, the world deserves it and you just might make someone&rsquo;s day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Thanks to&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-zen/\">Donna Zen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ann-mathulla/\">Ann Mathulla</a>&nbsp;for reading drafts of this.</p>",

But they’re often worried about coming across as pretentious or boastful. 30% of the time their humility is a very admirable trait, however the other 70% of the time, I think their modesty robs a lot of people of a lot of value.",

The issue has been debated for over a decade, they say it is one of the most significant reforms to pass in the last 25 years, effects are expected to start materializing in 2018.<br/><br/></li>\n<li>The most exciting development is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" target=\"_blank\">Aadhaar</a> network, which essentially provides a biometric identity for over 970 million people. A lot of developing countries have problems keeping track of their lower class population which translates into problems with universal education, healthcare, microfinance etc. this effectively solves that issue.<br/><br/></li>\n<li>An advantage which India might have over China is better intellectual property protection. This advantage is tentative because China has been doing very well, studying the moves of others, “borrowing” what works, omitting what doesn’t and making a lot of money. However, It is very difficult to say what the lifespan for this strategy is but history has shown us that betting against China is like betting against the house in Las Vegas.<br/><br/></li>\n<li>Their post-secondary education system is impressive. More importantly, their attitude towards education is inspiring. There is a huge emphasis on the sciences, and students are heavily encouraged towards STEM fields. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are absolutely phenomenal and the alumni list is impressive. Contrast this with US which graduated 82,000 cosmetology students, 35,000 advertising students last year and 32,000 mechanical engineers.<br/><br/></li>\n<li>India’s IT sector also gets me quite excited, more specifically Wipro and Infosys are two companies which I am quite optimistic about going forward. Though I have to temper my optimism slightly. I like the two founders on a personal level, I like their ‘story’ and I am probably letting that slightly cloud my judgement . Interning in the IT Department of a bank I was amazed by the amount of times I walked around the office and my capitalist reflex kicked in thinking “a majority of these jobs could be automated or outsourced in the near future”. The amazing thing about Indian IT is how quickly they are propagating up the value chain. Gone are the days of ‘call center in India’ eventually (if not already) entire software projects will be outsourced.<br/><br/></li>\n<li>The bureaucracy and cronyism is still an issue that still needs more work to be done. The best example is the resignation of the Governor of the Indian Central bank, Mr. Raghuram Rajan. Mr . Rajan publically warned against worrisome credit problems before the 2008 financial crisis in 2005 Jackson Hole Symposiom, in front of many past and present central bank governors and is one of the few central bank governors reluctant to lower interest rates too easily. He was also critical of a complacency in the Indian government and economy and by developing-country standards he was seen as outspoken and mildly controversial. Internationally, he is regarded as a prescient man of great integrity and it was very likely he was pressured to step aside by vested interests in the government. Ensuring a true meritocracy where the best person is given the job,  will be another issue the Indian government must overcome.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\"> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73\" style=\"margin: 0px auto 1.7em; clear: both; color: #999999; font-size: 17.5px; font-style: italic; max-width: 199px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif;\"><a data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"139797257\" data-slb-group=\"64\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"The Eminent Raghuram Rajan [wikipedia.org]\" aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"nikon=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-73\" d100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1082552752\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"180\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}\"=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"73\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{\" data-image-title=\"rajan\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?fit=700%2C1053\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?fit=199%2C300\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?fit=997%2C1500\" data-orig-size=\"997,1500\" data-permalink=\"http://blog.tomiwa.ca/the-indian-model-what-china-nigeria-learn-from-india/rajan/\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?resize=199%2C300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?resize=199%2C300 199w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?resize=768%2C1155 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?resize=700%2C1053 700w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.tomiwa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rajan.jpg?w=997 997w\" style=\"border: 0px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; vertical-align: middle; display: block; margin: 0.4em auto 0px;\" width=\"199\"/></a>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0.9em 0px;\">Indian Central Bank Governor, Raghuram Rajan [wikipedia.org]</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">So I am currently thinking of how I can contribute and be a part of the amazing things happening in India.</span><br style=\"color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\"/><span style=\"color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">It would be very interesting to think about how Nigeria and similar countries (Ghana, Pakistan, North Korea etc.) can learn from and apply the Indian model.</span></p>",

But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, 'Let us march against Philip.' \" - David Ogilvy</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I can honestly say that my quality of life has been greatly improved from studying the teachings of the men and women who came before me. Since most of them are dead, I may not get the chance to personally thank them. However, I can do something even better and share some of the things which I’ve learnt with others and that will qualify as my way of saying thank you.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I am upset that many of the eminent people of our generation do not write more. Azim Premji, Li Ka-Shing, Elon Musk, Larry Page are all very accomplished, they have provided many lessons through the actions they have done with their lives. I would love them even more if they put their thoughts and ideas into writing so that posterity can be benefitted and we can get a more intimate understanding of how their minds work.</p>\n<h3>Persuasion</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">The first reason is the articulation of ideas. It’s really interesting how ‘you know what I mean’ is really just a translation for ‘I have no idea how to explain what I am thinking, please say you understand so I can stop talking’. There are those who have convinced themselves that as long as they have good ideas in their head, being able to actually bring them into this world is a pointless exercise. I am beginning to realize that being objectively correct is arguably just as important as convincing people that you are correct. I hope that by me taking these ideas from brain to paper, I develop a more organized structure of what I am thinking and how to communicate it to others. This transitions well to another reason.</p>\n<h3>Iron Sharpeneth Iron</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Welding of the mind. Similar to how metal becomes stronger when placed through fire, I believe that reasoning becomes stronger when placed through dissenting opinions. When I have an idea or hypothesis I actively seek out people who disagree with me so that they can tell me why or where I am wrong and I can develop stronger ideas. Keynes is useful once again, “When the facts change I change my mind, what do you do?”.</p>\n<h3>Reputation</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">This reason is partly self-serving and probably superficial. Benjamin Franklin used to push wheelbarrows back and forth through the streets of Boston, merely to develop a reputation as an industrious, reliable young man. I hope to push my ideas through society to develop a reputation as a young man with interesting insights, who is very receptive towards criticism and a great appetite for learning.</p>\n<h3>Self-Discipline</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">This is another one of my exercises in self-discipline. I have realized that my default state was slothful complacency and left to my own devices, I used to be perfectly content sleeping long hours and I am very proficient at procrastinating. But by diligently forcing myself to do difficult things I am slowly developing a habit which hates laziness and sloth.</p>\n<h3>Self-Improvement</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Finally, Virgil says in his Fourth Eclogue that eventually society will run out of different ways of doing things, (“<em>the ingenuity of change</em> having been <em>exhausted</em>”) and will closely resemble a period which came before it. I will borrow part of this idea and say that perhaps my first or second articles may not be good, but if I write enough, the ingenuity of writing poorly in different ways will be exhausted and there will be no other options left but to write something decent.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I finish with Rousseau<a href=\"http://blog.tomiwa.ca/why-i-write/#footnote1\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" target=\"_blank\">*</a>, “I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent and which, once complete, will have no imitator.

But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, 'Let us march against Philip.' \" - David Ogilvy</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I can honestly say that my quality of life has been greatly improved from studying the teachings of the men and women who came before me. Since most of them are dead, I may not get the chance to personally thank them. However, I can do something even better and share some of the things which I&rsquo;ve learnt with others and that will qualify as my way of saying thank you.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I am upset that many of the eminent people of our generation do not write more. Azim Premji, Li Ka-Shing, Elon Musk, Larry Page are all very accomplished, they have provided many lessons through the actions they have done with their lives. I would love them even more if they put their thoughts and ideas into writing so that posterity can be benefitted and we can get a more intimate understanding of how their minds work.</p>\n<h3>Persuasion</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">The first reason is the articulation of ideas. It&rsquo;s really interesting how &lsquo;you know what I mean&rsquo; is really just a translation for &lsquo;I have no idea how to explain what I am thinking, please say you understand so I can stop talking&rsquo;. There are those who have convinced themselves that as long as they have good ideas in their head, being able to actually bring them into this world is a pointless exercise. I am beginning to realize that being objectively correct is arguably just as important as convincing people that you are correct. I hope that by me taking these ideas from brain to paper, I develop a more organized structure of what I am thinking and how to communicate it to others. This transitions well to another reason.</p>\n<h3>Iron Sharpeneth Iron</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Welding of the mind. Similar to how metal becomes stronger when placed through fire, I believe that reasoning becomes stronger when placed through dissenting opinions. When I have an idea or hypothesis I actively seek out people who disagree with me so that they can tell me why or where I am wrong and I can develop stronger ideas. Keynes is useful once again, &ldquo;When the facts change I change my mind, what do you do?&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3>Reputation</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">This reason is partly self-serving and probably superficial. Benjamin Franklin used to push wheelbarrows back and forth through the streets of Boston, merely to develop a reputation as an industrious, reliable young man. I hope to push my ideas through society to develop a reputation as a young man with interesting insights, who is very receptive towards criticism and a great appetite for learning.</p>\n<h3>Self-Discipline</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">This is another one of my exercises in self-discipline. I have realized that my default state was slothful complacency and left to my own devices, I used to be perfectly content sleeping long hours and I am very proficient at procrastinating. But by diligently forcing myself to do difficult things I am slowly developing a habit which hates laziness and sloth.</p>\n<h3>Self-Improvement</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">Finally, Virgil says in his Fourth Eclogue that eventually society will run out of different ways of doing things, (&ldquo;<em>the ingenuity of change</em>&nbsp;having been&nbsp;<em>exhausted</em>&rdquo;) and will closely resemble a period which came before it. I will borrow part of this idea and say that&nbsp;perhaps my first or second articles may not be good, but if I write enough, the ingenuity of writing poorly in different ways will be exhausted and there will be no other options left but to write something decent.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: #444444; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', serif; font-size: 20px;\">I finish with Rousseau<a style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #34a4f9; transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, border-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out, opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;\" href=\"http://blog.tomiwa.ca/why-i-write/#footnote1\">*</a>, &ldquo;I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent and which, once complete, will have no imitator.
