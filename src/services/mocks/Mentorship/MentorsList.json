These attributes led to me moving across the world to study medicine in England in a six year program, where I also received my bachelor degree in clinical anatomy in addition to my medical degree.</p><p>I then began the tireless pursuit of training to become an OBGYN in Canada, and was blessed enough to receive a residency position at the University of Toronto. &nbsp;</p><p>I also have a passion for mentorship. I mentored prospective medical applicants from ethnic minorities and disadvantaged backgrounds throughout medical school, through my work with a charity called Birmingham Widening Access to Medicine. This charity strived to make studying medicine more accessible to underrepresented groups to increase diversity among physicians.</p><p>My passions include global health, women's health, research, advocacy, diversity and representation. I hope to continue to mentor and support those passionate about medicine or womens health, whether it be through examinations, interviews, personal statements, or anything in between,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
